9.1 WAVES IN ONE DIMENSION
9.1.1 The Wave Equation
What is a “wave”? I don’t think I can give you an entirely satisfactory answer—the
concept is intrinsically somewhat vague—but here’s a start: A wave is a distur-
bance of a continuous medium that propagates with a fixed shape at constant ve-
locity. Immediately I must add qualifiers: In the presence of absorption, the wave
will diminish in size as it moves; if the medium is dispersive, different frequencies
travel at different speeds; in two or three dimensions, as the wave spreads out, its
amplitude will decrease; and of course standing waves don’t propagate at all. But
these are refinements; let’s start with the simple case: fixed shape, constant speed
(Fig. 9.1).
How would you represent such an object mathematically? In the figure, I have
drawn the wave at two different times, once at t = 0, and again at some later
time t—each point on the wave form simply shifts to the right by an amount vt,
where v is the velocity. Maybe the wave is generated by shaking one end of a taut
string; f (z,t) represents the displacement of the string at the point z, at time t.
Given the initial shape of the string, g(z) ≡ f (z,0), what is the subsequent form,
f (z,t)? Well, the displacement at point z, at the later time t, is the same as the
displacement a distance vt to the left (i.e. at z− vt), back at time t = 0:
f (z,t)= f (z− vt,0)= g(z− vt). (9.1)
That statement captures (mathematically) the essence of wave motion. It tells us
that the function f (z,t), which might have depended on z and t in any old way,
in fact depends on them only in the very special combination z− vt; when that

is true, the function f (z,t) represents a wave of fixed shape traveling in the z
direction at speed v. For example, if A and b are constants (with the appropriate
units),
A
f1(z,t)= Ae−b(z−vt)2
, f2(z,t)= A sin[b(z− vt)], f3(z,t)=
b(z− vt)2 + 1
all represent waves (with different shapes, of course), but
f4(z,t)= Ae−b(bz2 +vt)
, and f5(z,t)= A sin(bz)cos(bvt)3
,
do not.
Why does a stretched string support wave motion? Actually, it follows from
Newton’s second law. Imagine a very long string under tension T . If it is displaced
from equilibrium, the net transverse force on the segment between z and z + z
(Fig. 9.2) is
F= T sin θ′
− T sin θ,
where θ′ is the angle the string makes with the z-direction at point z + z, and
θ is the corresponding angle at point z. Provided that the distortion of the string
is not too great, these angles are small (the figure is exaggerated, obviously), and
we can replace the sine by the tangent:

where v (which, as we’ll soon see, represents the speed of propagation) is

Equation 9.2 is known as the (classical) wave equation, because it admits as
solutions all functions of the form
f (z,t)= g(z− vt), (9.4)
(that is, all functions that depend on the variables z and t in the special combi-
nation u ≡ z− vt), and we have just learned that such functions represent waves
propagating in the z direction with speed v. For Eq. 9.4 means

Note that g(u) can be any (differentiable) function whatever. If the disturbance
propagates without changing its shape, then it satisfies the wave equation.
But functions of the form g(z− vt) are not the only solutions. The wave equa-
tion involves the square of v, so we can generate another class of solutions by
simply changing the sign of the velocity:
f (z,t)= h(z + vt). (9.5)
This, of course, represents a wave propagating in the negative z direction, and it is
certainly reasonable (on physical grounds) that such solutions would be allowed.
What is perhaps surprising is that the most general solution to the wave equation
is the sum of a wave to the right and a wave to the left:
f (z,t)= g(z− vt) + h(z + vt). (9.6)
9.1 Waves in One Dimension 385
(Notice that the wave equation is linear: The sum of any two solutions is itself a
solution.) Every solution to the wave equation can be expressed in this form.
Like the simple harmonic oscillator equation, the wave equation is ubiquitous
in physics. If something is vibrating, the oscillator equation is almost certainly
responsible (at least, for small amplitudes), and if something is waving (whether
the context is mechanics or acoustics, optics or oceanography), the wave equation
(perhaps with some decoration) is bound to be involved.
Problem 9.1 By explicit differentiation, check that the functions f1, f2, and f3 in
the text satisfy the wave equation. Show that f4 and f5 do not.
Problem 9.2 Show that the standing wave f (z, t)= A sin(kz) cos(kvt) satisfies
the wave equation, and express it as the sum of a wave traveling to the left and a
wave traveling to the right (Eq. 9.6).
9.1.2 Sinusoidal Waves
(i) Terminology. Of all possible wave forms, the sinusoidal one
f (z,t)= A cos[k(z− vt) + δ] (9.7)
is (for good reason) the most familiar. Figure 9.3 shows this function at time t = 0.
A is the amplitude of the wave (it is positive, and represents the maximum dis-
placement from equilibrium). The argument of the cosine is called the phase, and
δ is the phase constant (obviously, you can add any integer multiple of 2π to δ
without changing f (z,t); ordinarily, one uses a value in the range 0 ≤ δ < 2π).
Notice that at z = vt− δ/k, the phase is zero; let’s call this the “central maxi-
mum.” If δ= 0, the central maximum passes the origin at time t = 0; more gen-
erally, δ/k is the distance by which the central maximum (and therefore the entire
wave) is “delayed.” Finally, k is the wave number; it is related to the wavelength
λ by the equation
2π
λ=
k, (9.8)
for when z advances by 2π/k, the cosine executes one complete cycle.

For our purposes, a more convenient unit is the angular frequency ω, so-called
because in the analogous case of uniform circular motion, it represents the number
of radians swept out per unit time:
ω = 2πν = kv. (9.11)
Ordinarily, it’s nicer to write sinusoidal waves (Eq. 9.7) in terms of ω, rather
than v:
f (z,t)= A cos(kz− ωt + δ). (9.12)
A sinusoidal oscillation of wave number k and (angular) frequency ω traveling
to the left would be written
f (z,t)= A cos (kz + ωt− δ). (9.13)
The sign of the phase constant is chosen for consistency with our previous con-
vention that δ/k shall represent the distance by which the wave is “delayed” (since
the wave is now moving to the left, a delay means a shift to the right). At t = 0,
the wave looks like Fig. 9.4. Because the cosine is an even function, we can just
as well write Eq. 9.13 thus:
f (z,t)= A cos(−kz− ωt + δ). (9.14)
Comparison with Eq. 9.12 reveals that, in effect, we could simply switch the sign
of k to produce a wave with the same amplitude, phase constant, frequency, and
wavelength, traveling in the opposite direction.

(ii) Complex notation. In view of Euler’s formula,
ei θ
= cos θ + i sin θ, (9.15)
the sinusoidal wave (Eq. 9.12) can be written
f (z,t)= Re Aei (kz−ωt+δ)
, (9.16)
where Re(ξ) denotes the real part of the complex number ξ. This invites us to
introduce the complex wave function
˜
f (z,t) ≡
˜
Aei (kz−ωt)
, (9.17)
with the complex amplitude˜
A ≡ Aei δ absorbing the phase constant. The actual
wave function is the real part of˜
f :
˜
f (z,t)= Re[
f (z,t)]. (9.18)
If you know˜
f , it is a simple matter to find f ; the advantage of the complex
notation is that exponentials are much easier to manipulate than sines and cosines.
Example 9.1. Suppose you want to combine two sinusoidal waves:
˜

f3 = f1 + f2 = Re(

f2)= Re(
f1 +
˜
˜
f2)= Re(
f3),
with˜

f3 =

wave number,
˜
f2. You simply add the corresponding complex wave functions,
and then take the real part. In particular, if they have the same frequency and
˜
f3 =
˜
A1ei (kz−ωt) +
˜
A2ei (kz−ωt) =
˜
A3ei (kz−ωt)
,
where
˜
A3 =
˜
A1 +
˜
A2, or A3ei δ3 = A1ei δ1 + A2ei δ2
. (9.19)
In other words, you just add the (complex) amplitudes. The combined wave still
has the same frequency and wavelength,
f3(z,t)= A3 cos (kz− ωt + δ3),
and you can easily figure out A3 and δ3 from Eq. 9.19 (Prob. 9.3). Try doing
this without using the complex notation—you will find yourself looking up trig
identities and slogging through nasty algebra.
(iii) Linear combinations of sinusoidal waves. Although the sinusoidal function
(Eq. 9.17) is a very special wave form, the fact is that any wave can be expressed
as a linear combination of sinusoidal ones:
˜
f (z,t)=
∞
−∞
˜
A(k)ei (kz−ωt) dk. (9.20)
388 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves
Here ω is a function of k (Eq. 9.11), and I have allowed k to run through negative
values in order to include waves going both directions.1
The formula for˜
A(k), in terms of the initial conditions f (z,0) and˙
f (z,0),
can be obtained from the theory of Fourier transforms (see Prob. 9.33), but the
details are not relevant to my purpose here. The point is that any wave can be
written as a linear combination of sinusoidal waves, and therefore if you know
how sinusoidal waves behave, you know in principle how any wave behaves. So
from now on, we shall confine our attention to sinusoidal waves.
Problem 9.3 Use Eq. 9.19 to determine A3 and δ3 in terms of A1, A2, δ1, and δ2.
Problem 9.4 Obtain Eq. 9.20 directly from the wave equation, by separation of
variables.
9.1.3 Boundary Conditions: Reflection and Transmission
So far, I have assumed the string is infinitely long—or at any rate long enough that
we don’t need to worry about what happens to a wave when it reaches the end. As
a matter of fact, what happens depends a lot on how the string is attached—that
is, on the specific boundary conditions to which the wave is subject. Suppose,
for instance, that the string is simply tied onto a second string. The tension T is
the same for both, but the mass per unit length μ presumably is not, and hence
the wave velocities v1 and v2 are different (remember, v = √T /μ). Let’s say, for
convenience, that the knot occurs at z = 0. The incident wave
˜
fI (z,t)=
˜
AI ei (k1 z−ωt), (z < 0), (9.21)
coming in from the left, gives rise to a reflected wave
˜
fR (z,t)=
˜
AR ei (−k1 z−ωt), (z < 0), (9.22)
traveling back along string 1 (hence the minus sign in front of k1), in addition to
a transmitted wave
˜
fT (z,t)=
˜
AT ei (k2 z−ωt), (z > 0), (9.23)
which continues on to the right in string 2.
The incident wave fI (z,t) is a sinusoidal oscillation that extends (in principle)
all the way back to z = −∞, and has been doing so for all of history. The same
goes for fR and fT (except that the latter, of course, extends to z = +∞). All parts
of the system are oscillating at the same frequency ω (a frequency determined by
the person at z = −∞, who is shaking the string in the first place). Since the
1This does not mean that λ and ω are negative—wavelength and frequency are always positive. If
we allow negative wave numbers, then Eqs. 9.8 and 9.11 should really be written λ= 2π/|k| and
ω = |k|v.

wave velocities are different in the two strings, however, the wavelengths and
wave numbers are also different:

v2
Of course, this situation is pretty artificial—what’s more, with incident and re-
flected waves of infinite extent traveling on the same piece of string, it’s going to
be hard for a spectator to tell them apart. You might therefore prefer to consider
an incident wave of finite extent—say, the pulse shown in Fig. 9.5. You can work
out the details for yourself, if you like (Prob. 9.5). The trouble with this approach
is that no finite pulse is truly sinusoidal. The waves in Fig. 9.5 may look like sine
functions, but they’re not: they’re little pieces of sines, joined onto an entirely dif-
ferent function (namely, zero). Like any other waves, they can be built up as linear
combinations of true sinusoidal functions (Eq. 9.20), but only by putting together
a whole range of frequencies and wavelengths. If you want a single incident fre-
quency (as we shall in the electromagnetic case), you must let your waves extend
to infinity. (In practice, if you use a very long pulse, with many oscillations, it will
be close to the ideal of a single frequency.)
For a sinusoidal incident wave, then, the net disturbance of the string is:
˜
f (z,t)=
⎧ ⎨ ⎩˜
AI ei (k1 z−ωt) +
˜
AR ei (−k1 z−ωt)
, for z < 0,
˜
AT ei (k2 z−ωt)
, for z > 0.
(9.25)
At the join (z = 0), the displacement just slightly to the left (z = 0−) must equal
the displacement slightly to the right (z = 0+)—else there would be a break
between the two strings. Mathematically, f (z,t) is continuous at z = 0:
f (0−
,t)= f (0+
,t). (9.26)
If the knot itself is of negligible mass, then the derivative of f must also be
continuous:

Otherwise there would be a net force on the knot, and therefore an infinite
acceleration (Fig. 9.6). These boundary conditions apply directly to the real wave
function f (z,t). But since the imaginary part of˜
f differs from the real part only
in the replacement of cosine by sine (Eq. 9.15), it follows that the complex wave
function˜
f (z,t) obeys the same rules:

When applied to Eq. 9.25, these boundary conditions determine the outgoing

AI ):
˜

AR =

from which it follows that
˜

Or, in terms of the velocities (Eq. 9.24):
˜
AR =
v2− v1
v2 + v1
˜
AI ,
˜
AT =
2v2
v2 + v1
˜
AI. (9.30)
The real amplitudes and phases, then, are related by
AR ei δR =
v2− v1
v2 + v1
AI ei δI
, AT ei δT =
2v2
v2 + v1
AI ei δI
. (9.31)
If the second string is lighter than the first (μ2 < μ1, so that v2 > v1), all three
waves have the same phase angle (δR = δT = δI ), and the outgoing amplitudes
are
AR =
v2− v1
v2 + v1
AI , AT =
2v2
v2 + v1
AI. (9.32)
If the second string is heavier than the first (v2 < v1), the reflected wave is out of
phase by 180◦ (δR + π = δT = δI ). In other words, since
cos (−k1 z− ωt + δI− π)= −cos (−k1 z− ωt + δI ),
9.1 Waves in One Dimension 391
the reflected wave is “upside down.” The amplitudes in this case are
AR =
v1− v2
v2 + v1
AI and AT =
2v2
v2 + v1
AI. (9.33)
In particular, if the second string is infinitely massive—or, what amounts to the
same thing, if the first string is simply nailed down at the end—then
AR = AI and AT = 0.
Naturally, in this case there is no transmitted wave—all of it reflects back.

Problem 9.5 Suppose you send an incident wave of specified shape, gI (z− v1t),
down string number 1. It gives rise to a reflected wave, h R (z + v1t), and a transmit-
ted wave, gT (z− v2t). By imposing the boundary conditions 9.26 and 9.27, find h R
and gT.

(a) Formulate an appropriate boundary condition, to replace Eq. 9.27, for the case
of two strings under tension T joined by a knot of mass m.
(b) Find the amplitude and phase of the reflected and transmitted waves for the case
where the knot has a mass m and the second string is massless.

which imposes a drag force that is proportional to its (transverse) speed:

F(z).
(c) Show that the waves are attenuated (that is, their amplitude decreases with in-
creasing z). Find the characteristic penetration distance, at which the amplitude
is 1/e of its original value, in terms of γ, T , μ, and ω.
(d) If a wave of amplitude AI , phase δI = 0, and frequency ω is incident from the
left (string 1), find the reflected wave’s amplitude and phase.
9.1.4 Polarization
The waves that travel down a string when you shake it are called transverse,
because the displacement is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. If the
string is reasonably elastic, it is also possible to stimulate compression waves, by
giving the string little tugs. Compression waves are hard to see on a string, but if
you try it with a slinky they’re quite noticeable (Fig. 9.7). These waves are called
longitudinal, because the displacement from equilibrium is along the direction of
392 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves
FIGURE 9.7
propagation. Sound waves, which are nothing but compression waves in air, are
longitudinal; electromagnetic waves, as we shall see, are transverse.
Now there are, of course, two dimensions perpendicular to any given line of
propagation. Accordingly, transverse waves occur in two independent states of
polarization: you can shake the string up-and-down (“vertical” polarization—
Fig. 9.8a),

Problem 9.8 Equation 9.36 describes the most general linearly polarized wave on
a string. Linear (or “plane”) polarization (so called because the displacement is par-
allel to a fixed vectorˆ
n) results from the combination of horizontally and vertically
polarized waves of the same phase (Eq. 9.39). If the two components are of equal
amplitude, but out of phase by 90◦ (say, δv = 0, δh = 90◦), the result is a circularly
polarized wave. In that case:
(a) At a fixed point z, show that the string moves in a circle about the z axis. Does it
go clockwise or counterclockwise, as you look down the axis toward the origin?
How would you construct a wave circling the other way? (In optics, the clock-
wise case is called right circular polarization, and the counterclockwise, left
circular polarization.)3
(b) Sketch the string at time t = 0.
(c) How would you shake the string in order to produce a circularly polarized wave?

The Wave Equation for E and B
In regions of space where there is no charge or current, Maxwell’s equations read

They constitute a set of coupled, first-order, partial differential equations for E

(This is the same as Eq. 9.2, except that ∂2 f /∂z2 is replaced by its natural gen-

propagation of electromagnetic waves, traveling at a speed

which happens to be precisely the velocity of light, c. The implication is astound-
ing: Perhaps light is an electromagnetic wave.4 Of course, this conclusion does
not surprise anyone today, but imagine what a revelation it was in Maxwell’s time!
Remember how ϵ0 and μ0 came into the theory in the first place: they were con-
stants in Coulomb’s law and the Biot-Savart law, respectively. You measure them
in experiments involving charged pith balls, batteries, and wires—experiments
having nothing whatever to do with light. And yet, according to Maxwell’s the-
ory, you can calculate c from these two numbers. Notice the crucial role played by
Maxwell’s contribution to Ampère’s law (μ0ϵ0∂E/∂t); without it, the wave equa-
tion would not emerge, and there would be no electromagnetic theory of light.
9.2.2 Monochromatic Plane Waves
For reasons discussed in Sect. 9.1.2, we may confine our attention to sinusoidal
waves of frequency ω. Since different frequencies in the visible range correspond

undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.” See Ivan

moreover, that the waves are traveling in the z direction and have no x or y depen-
dence; these are called plane waves,
5 because the fields are uniform over every
plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation (Fig. 9.9). We are interested,
then, in fields of the form
˜
E(z,t)=
˜
E0ei (kz−ωt)

˜

where˜
E0 and˜
B0 are the (complex) amplitudes (the physical fields, of course, are
the real parts of˜
E and˜
B), and ω = ck.
Now, the wave equations for E and B (Eq. 9.41) were derived from Maxwell’s
equations. However, whereas every solution to Maxwell’s equations (in empty
space) must obey the wave equation, the converse is not true; Maxwell’s equa-
tions impose extra constraints on˜

∇· B= 0, it follows6 that

That is, electromagnetic waves are transverse: the electric and magnetic fields are
perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Moreover, Faraday’s law, ∇ × E=
−∂B/∂t, implies a relation between the electric and magnetic amplitudes, to wit:

Or work Prob. 9.35. Of course, over small enough regions any wave is essentially plane, as long as the
wavelength is much less than the radius of the curvature of the wave front.
6Because the real part of˜
E differs from the imaginary part only in the replacement of sine by cosine,
if the former obeys Maxwell’s equations, so does the latter, and hence˜
E as well.

This is the paradigm for a monochromatic plane wave (see Fig. 9.10). The wave
as a whole is said to be polarized in the x direction (by convention, we use the
direction of E to specify the polarization of an electromagnetic wave).
There is nothing special about the z direction, of course—we can easily gen-
eralize to monochromatic plane waves traveling in an arbitrary direction. The no-
tation is facilitated by the introduction of the propagation (or wave) vector, k,
pointing in the direction of propagation, whose magnitude is the wave number k.
The scalar product k· r is the appropriate generalization of kz (Fig. 9.11), so

According to Eq. 8.5, the energy per unit volume in electromagnetic fields is

In the case of a monochromatic plane wave (Eq. 9.48)

so the electric and magnetic contributions are equal:
u = ϵ0 E2
= ϵ0 E2
0 cos2 (kz− ωt + δ). (9.55)
As the wave travels, it carries this energy along with it. The energy flux den-
sity (energy per unit area, per unit time) transported by the fields is given by the
Poynting vector (Eq. 8.10):

S=

Notice that S is the energy density (u) times the velocity of the waves (cˆ
z)—as it
should be. For in a time t, a length c t passes through area A (Fig. 9.12), carry-
ing with it an energy u Ac t. The energy per unit time, per unit area, transported
by the wave is therefore uc.
Electromagnetic fields not only carry energy, they also carry momentum. In
fact, we found in Eq. 8.29 that the momentum density stored in the fields is

In the case of light, the wavelength is so short (∼ 5 × 10−7 m), and the period
so brief (∼ 10−15 s), that any macroscopic measurement will encompass many
cycles. Typically, therefore, we’re not interested in the fluctuating cosine-squared
term in the energy and momentum densities; all we want is the average value.
Now, the average of cosine-squared over a complete cycle7 is 1

magnetic wave is called the intensity:

7There is a cute trick for doing this in your head: sin2 θ + cos2 θ= 1, and over a complete cycle the
average of sin2 θ is equal to the average of cos2 θ, so ⟨sin2⟩ = ⟨cos2⟩ = 1/2. More formally,

When light falls (at normal incidence) on a perfect absorber, it delivers its
momentum to the surface. In a time t, the momentum transfer is (Fig. 9.12)

(On a perfect reflector the pressure is twice as great, because the momentum
switches direction, instead of simply being absorbed.) We can account for this
pressure qualitatively, as follows: The electric field (Eq. 9.48) drives charges in
the x direction, and the magnetic field then exerts on them a force q(v × B) in the
z direction. The net force on all the charges in the surface produces the pressure.8
Problem 9.10 The intensity of sunlight hitting the earth is about 1300 W/m2. If
sunlight strikes a perfect absorber, what pressure does it exert? How about a perfect
reflector? What fraction of atmospheric pressure does this amount to?
Problem 9.11 Consider a particle of charge q and mass m, free to move in the
x y plane in response to an electromagnetic wave propagating in the z direction
(Eq. 9.48—might as well set δ= 0).
(a) Ignoring the magnetic force, find the velocity of the particle, as a function of
time. (Assume the average velocity is zero.)
(b) Now calculate the resulting magnetic force on the particle.
(c) Show that the (time) average magnetic force is zero.
The problem with this naive model for the pressure of light is that the velocity is
90◦ out of phase with the fields. For energy to be absorbed, there’s got to be some
resistance to the motion of the charges. Suppose we include a force of the form
−γmv, for some damping constant γ.
(d) Repeat part (a) (ignore the exponentially damped transient). Repeat part (b), and
find the average magnetic force on the particle.9
Problem 9.12 In the complex notation there is a clever device for finding the
time average of a product. Suppose f (r, t)= A cos (k· r− ωt + δa ) and g(r,t)=
˜
B cos (k· r− ωt + δb ). Show that ⟨ f g⟩ = (1/2)Re(
f˜
g∗), where the star denotes
complex conjugation. [Note that this only works if the two waves have the same k
and ω, but they need not have the same amplitude or phase.] For example,

Problem 9.13 Find all elements of the Maxwell stress tensor for a monochromatic
plane wave traveling in the z direction and linearly polarized in the x direction
(Eq. 9.48). Does your answer make sense? (Remember that−
↔ T represents the
momentum flux density.) How is the momentum flux density related to the energy
density, in this case?
8Actually, it’s a little more subtle than this—see Prob. 9.11.

10 This observation is mathematically pretty trivial, but the physical implications are astonishing: As
the wave passes through, the fields busily polarize and magnetize all the molecules, and the resulting
(oscillating) dipoles create their own electric and magnetic fields. These combine with the original
fields in such a way as to create a single wave with the same frequency but a different speed. This
extraordinary conspiracy (known in optics as the Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem) is responsible
for the phenomenon of transparency. It is a distinctly nontrivial consequence of linearity. For further
discussion see M. B. James and D. J. Griffiths, Am. J. Phys. 60, 309 (1992); H. Fearn, D. F. V. James,

These equations relate the electric and magnetic fields just to the left and just to
the right of the interface between two linear media. In the following sections, we
use them to deduce the laws governing reflection and refraction of electromag-
netic waves.
11 The dielectric constant is “constant” in the sense of being independent of the amplitude of E, but
it may well depend on the frequency, as we shall see. Thus, for example, if you quote the (static)
dielectric constant for water, from Table 4.2, you will conclude that the index of refraction is 8.9,
which is wildly off, for visible light (n = 1.33).
12 See Prob. 8.23; refer to Sect. 4.4.3 for the precise meaning of “energy density,” in the context of
linear media.
13 The momentum carried by an electromagnetic wave in matter is controversial. See, for example,

most of the light is transmitted.
Problem 9.14 Calculate the exact reflection and transmission coefficients, without
assuming μ1 = μ2 = μ0. Confirm that R + T= 1.
Problem 9.15 In writing Eqs. 9.76 and 9.77, I tacitly assumed that the reflected

9.3.3 Reflection and Transmission at Oblique Incidence
In the last section, I treated reflection and transmission at normal incidence—that
is, when the incoming wave hits the interface head-on. We now turn to the more
general case of oblique incidence, in which the incoming wave meets the bound-
ary at an arbitrary angle θI (Fig. 9.14). Of course, normal incidence is really just a
special case of oblique incidence, with θI = 0, but I wanted to treat it separately,
as a kind of warm-up, because the algebra is now going to get a little heavy.

I’ll fill in the parentheses in a moment; for now, the important thing to notice is
that the x, y, and t dependence is confined to the exponents. Because the boundary
conditions must hold at all points on the plane, and for all times, these exponential
factors must be equal (when z = 0). Otherwise, a slight change in x, say, would
destroy the equality (see Prob. 9.16). Of course, the time factors are already equal
(in fact, you could regard this as a confirmation that the transmitted and reflected
frequencies must match the incident one). As for the spatial terms, evidently
kI· r = kR· r = kT· r, when z = 0, (9.94)
14 Nonlinear (“active”) media can change the frequency, but we are talking only about linear media.

or, more explicitly,
x(kI )x + y(kI )y = x(kR )x + y(kR )y = x(kT )x + y(kT )y , (9.95)
for all x and all y.
we get
But Eq. 9.95 can only hold if the components are separately equal, for if x = 0,
(kI )y = (kR )y = (kT )y , (9.96)
while y= 0 gives
(kI )x = (kR )x = (kT )x. (9.97)
We may as well orient our axes so that kI lies in the x z plane (i.e. (kI )y = 0);
according to Eq. 9.96, so too will kR and kT. Conclusion:
First Law: The incident, reflected, and transmitted wave vectors
form a plane (called the plane of incidence), which also includes the
normal to the surface (here, the z axis).
Meanwhile, Eq. 9.97 implies that
kI sin θI = kR sin θR = kT sin θT , (9.98)
where θI is the angle of incidence, θR is the angle of reflection, and θT is the
angle of transmission (more commonly known as the angle of refraction), all of
them measured with respect to the normal (Fig. 9.14). In view of Eq. 9.92, then,
Second Law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of
reflection,
θI = θR. (9.99)
This is the law of reflection.
As for the transmitted angle,
Third Law:

This is the law of refraction—Snell’s law.
These are the three fundamental laws of geometrical optics. It is remarkable
how little actual electrodynamics went into them: we have yet to invoke any spe-
cific boundary conditions—all we used was their generic form (Eq. 9.93). There-
fore, any other waves (water waves, for instance, or sound waves) can be expected
to obey the same “optical” laws when they pass from one medium into another.

These are known as Fresnel’s equations, for the case of polarization in the plane
of incidence. (There are two other Fresnel equations, giving the reflected and
transmitted amplitudes when the polarization is perpendicular to the plane of
incidence—see Prob. 9.17.) Notice that the transmitted wave is always in phase
with the incident one; the reflected wave is either in phase (“right side up”), if
α > β, or 180◦ out of phase (“upside down”), if α < β.

grazing incidence (θI = 90◦), α diverges, and the wave is totally reflected (a fact
15 There is an unavoidable ambiguity in the phase of the reflected wave, since (as I mentioned in the
footnote to Eq. 9.36) changing the sign of the polarization vector is equivalent to a 180◦ phase shift.

naturally, it goes to zero at Brewster’s angle; T is the fraction transmitted—it

9.4 ABSORPTION AND DISPERSION
9.4.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Conductors
In Sect. 9.3 I stipulated that the free charge density ρf and the free current density
J f are zero, and everything that followed was predicated on that assumption. Such
a restriction is perfectly reasonable when you’re talking about wave propagation
through a vacuum or through insulating materials such as glass or (pure) water.
But in the case of conductors we do not independently control the flow of charge,
and in general J f is certainly not zero. In fact, according to Ohm’s law, the (free)
current density in a conductor is proportional to the electric field:
J f = σE. (9.117)
With this, Maxwell’s equations for linear media assume the form

for a homogeneous linear medium, from which it follows that
ρf (t)= e−(σ/ϵ)t ρf (0). (9.120)
Thus any initial free charge ρf (0) dissipates in a characteristic time τ ≡ ϵ/σ. This
reflects the familiar fact that if you put some free charge on a conductor, it will
flow out to the edges. The time constant τ affords a measure of how “good” a con-
ductor is: For a “perfect” conductor, σ = ∞ and τ = 0; for a “good” conductor,
τ is much less than the other relevant times in the problem (in oscillatory systems,
that means τ ≪ 1/ω); for a “poor” conductor, τ is greater than the characteris-
tic times in the problem (τ ≫ 1/ω).17 But we’re not interested in this transient
17 N. Ashby, Am. J. Phys. 43, 553 (1975), points out that for good conductors τ is absurdly short
(10−19 s, for copper, whereas the time between collisions is τc = 10−14 s). The problem is that Ohm’s
law itself breaks down on time scales shorter than τc ; actually, the time it takes free charge to dissipate
in a good conductor is of order τc , not τ. Moreover, H. C. Ohanian, Am. J. Phys. 51, 1020 (1983),
shows that it takes even longer for the fields and currents to equilibrate. But none of this is relevant
to our present purpose; the net free charge density in a conductor does quickly dissipate, and exactly
how long the process takes is beside the point.

where σf (not to be confused with conductivity) is the free surface charge, K f
is the free surface current, andˆ
n (not to be confused with the polarization of the
wave) is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface, pointing from medium (2)
into medium (1). For ohmic conductors (J f = σE) there can be no free surface
current, since this would require an infinite electric field at the boundary.
Suppose now that the x y plane forms the boundary between a nonconducting
linear medium (1) and a conductor (2). A monochromatic plane wave, traveling

In this case the wave is totally reflected, with a 180◦ phase shift. (That’s why
excellent conductors make good mirrors. In practice, you paint a thin coating of
silver onto the back of a pane of glass—the glass has nothing to do with the
reflection; it’s just there to support the silver and to keep it from tarnishing. Since
the skin depth in silver at optical frequencies is less than 100 Å, you don’t need a
very thick layer.)
Problem 9.22 Calculate the reflection coefficient for light at an air-to-silver inter-
face (μ1 = μ2 = μ0, ϵ1 = ϵ0, σ = 6 × 107(· m)−1), at optical frequencies (ω =

9.4.3 The Frequency Dependence of Permittivity
In the preceding sections, we have seen that the propagation of electromagnetic
waves through matter is governed by three properties of the material: the permit-
tivity ϵ, the permeability μ, and the conductivity σ. Actually, each of these param-
eters depends to some extent on the frequency of the waves you are considering.
Indeed, it is well known from optics that n
∼
= √ϵr is a function of wavelength
(Fig. 9.19 shows the graph for a typical glass). A prism or a raindrop bends blue
light more sharply than red, and spreads white light out into a rainbow of colors.
This phenomenon is called dispersion. By extension, whenever the speed of a
wave depends on its frequency, the supporting medium is called dispersive.

as it propagates. A sharply peaked wave typically flattens out, and whereas each
sinusoidal component travels at the ordinary wave (or phase) velocity,
ω
v =
k, (9.149)
the packet as a whole (the “envelope”) moves at the so-called group velocity18
vg =
dω
dk. (9.150)
[You can demonstrate this by dropping a rock into the nearest pond and watching
the waves that form: While the disturbance as a whole spreads out in a circle,
moving at speed vg , the ripples that go to make it up will be seen to travel twice
as fast (v = 2vg in this case). They appear at the back end of the packet, growing
as they move forward to the center, then shrinking again and fading away at the
front (Fig. 9.20).] We shall not concern ourselves with these matters—I’ll stick
to monochromatic waves, for which the problem does not arise. But I should
just mention that the energy carried by a wave packet in a dispersive medium
does not travel at the phase velocity. Don’t be too alarmed, therefore, if in some
circumstances v comes out greater than c.

Crawford, Jr., Waves (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1968), Sect. 6.2.
19 Even the group velocity can exceed c in special cases—see P. C. Peters, Am. J. Phys. 56, 129 (1988),
or work Prob. 9.26. For delightful commentary, see C. F. Bohren, Am. J. Phys. 77, 101 (2009). And if
two different “speeds of light” are not enough to satisfy you, check out S. C. Bloch, Am. J. Phys. 45,
538 (1977), in which no fewer than eight distinct velocities are identified! Indeed, it’s not clear what
you mean by the “velocity” of something that changes shape as it moves, and has no precise beginning
or end. Do you mean the speed at which the peak intensity propagates? Or the speed at which energy
is transported? Or information transmitted? In special relativity no causal signal can travel faster than
c, but some of the other “velocities” have no such restriction.

FIGURE 9.20
My purpose in this section is to account for the frequency dependence of ϵ
in dielectrics, using a simplified model for the behavior of the electrons. Like all
classical models of atomic-scale phenomena, it is at best an approximation to the
truth; nevertheless, it does yield qualitatively satisfactory results, and it provides
a plausible mechanism for dispersion in transparent media.
The electrons in a nonconductor are bound to specific molecules. The actual
binding forces can be quite complicated, but we shall picture each electron as
attached to the end of a spring, with force constant kspring (Fig. 9.21):
Fbinding = −kspring x = −mω2
0 x, (9.151)
where x is displacement from equilibrium, m is the electron’s mass, and ω0 is
the natural oscillation frequency, kspring/m. [If this strikes you as an implausible
model, look back at Ex. 4.1, where we were led to a force of precisely this form.
As a matter of fact, practically any binding force can be approximated this way for
sufficiently small displacements from equilibrium, as you can see by expanding
the potential energy in a Taylor series about the equilibrium point:
U (x)= U (0) + xU ′(0) +
1
2
x2U ′′(0) + ···.
The first term is a constant, with no dynamical significance (you can always adjust
the zero of potential energy so that U (0)= 0). The second term automatically
vanishes, since dU/d x= −F, and by the nature of an equilibrium, the force at
that point is zero. The third term is precisely the potential energy of a spring with
force constant kspring = d2U/d x2
0 (the second derivative is positive, for a point
of stable equilibrium). As long as the displacements are small, the higher terms in
the series can be neglected. Geometrically, all I am saying is that practically any
function can be fit near a minimum by a suitable parabola.]

Meanwhile, there will presumably be some damping force on the electron:
d x
Fdamping = −mγ
dt. (9.152)
[Again I have chosen the simplest possible form; the damping must be opposite in
direction to the velocity, and making it proportional to the velocity is the easiest
way to accomplish this. The cause of the damping does not concern us here—
among other things, an oscillating charge radiates, and the radiation siphons off
energy. We will calculate this “radiation damping” in Chapter 11.]
In the presence of an electromagnetic wave of frequency ω, polarized in the x
direction (Fig. 9.21), the electron is subject to a driving force
Fdriving = q E= q E0 cos(ωt), (9.153)
where q is the charge of the electron and E0 is the amplitude of the wave at the
point z where the electron is situated. (Since we’re only interested in one point, I
have reset the clock so that the maximum E occurs there at t = 0. For simplicity,
I assume the magnetic force is negligible.) Putting all this into Newton’s second
law gives

dt2
or
m
d2 x
dt2 + mγ

0 x = q E0 cos(ωt). (9.154)
Our model, then, describes the electron as a damped harmonic oscillator, driven
at frequency ω. (The much more massive nucleus remains at rest.)

equation:

The imaginary term in the denominator means that p is out of phase with E—
lagging behind by an angle tan−1[γω/(ω2
0− ω2)] that is very small when ω ≪ ω0
and rises to π when ω ≫ ω0.
In general, differently situated electrons within a given molecule experience
different natural frequencies and damping coefficients. Let’s say there are f j
electrons with frequency ωj and damping γj in each molecule. If there are N
molecules per unit volume, the polarization P is given by20 the real part of

Now, I defined the electric susceptibility as the proportionality constant between
P and E (specifically, P= ϵ0χeE). In the present case, P is not proportional to E
(this is not, strictly speaking, a linear medium) because of the difference in phase.
However, the complex polarization˜
P is proportional to the complex field˜
E, and
this suggests that we introduce a complex susceptibility,
˜
χe:
˜

P= ϵ0˜

ing that the physical polarization is the real part of˜

the real part of˜
E. In particular, the proportionality between˜
D and˜

Ordinarily, the imaginary term is negligible; however, when ω is very close to one

20This applies directly to the case of a dilute gas; for denser materials the theory is modified slightly,
in accordance with the Clausius-Mossotti equation (Prob. 4.41). By the way, don’t confuse the “polar-
ization” of a medium, P, with the “polarization” of a wave—same word, but two completely unrelated
meanings.

Eq. 9.163 becomes

The wave is attenuated (this is hardly surprising, since the damping absorbs
energy). Because the intensity is proportional to E2 (and hence to e−2κz ), the
quantity
α ≡ 2κ (9.167)
is called the absorption coefficient. Meanwhile, the wave velocity is ω/k, and
the index of refraction is

I have deliberately used notation reminiscent of Sect. 9.4.1. However, in the
present case k and κ have nothing to do with conductivity; rather, they are deter-
mined by the parameters of our damped harmonic oscillator. For gases, the second
term in Eq. 9.161 is small, and we can approximate the square root (Eq. 9.164) by

In Fig. 9.22 I have plotted the index of refraction and the absorption coefficient
in the vicinity of one of the resonances. Most of the time the index of refraction
rises gradually with increasing frequency, consistent with our experience from
optics (Fig. 9.19). However, in the immediate neighborhood of a resonance the
index of refraction drops sharply. Because this behavior is atypical, it is called

anomalous dispersion. Notice that the region of anomalous dispersion (ω1 <
ω < ω2, in the figure) coincides with the region of maximum absorption; in fact,
the material may be practically opaque in this frequency range. The reason is that
we are now driving the electrons at their “favorite” frequency; the amplitude of
their oscillation is relatively large, and a correspondingly large amount of energy
is dissipated by the damping mechanism.
In Fig. 9.22, n runs below 1 above the resonance, suggesting that the wave
speed exceeds c. As I mentioned earlier, this is no immediate cause for alarm,
since energy does not travel at the wave velocity. Moreover, the graph does not
include the contributions of other terms in the sum, which add a relatively con-
stant “background” that, in some cases, keeps n > 1 on both sides of the reso-
nance. Incidentally, the group velocity can also exceed c in the neighborhood of a
resonance, in this model (see Prob. 9.26).
If you agree to stay away from the resonances, the damping can be ignored,
and the formula for the index of refraction simplifies:

Or, in terms of the wavelength in vacuum (λ= 2πc/ω):

This is known as Cauchy’s formula; the constant A is called the coefficient of re-
fraction, and B is called the coefficient of dispersion. Cauchy’s equation applies
reasonably well to most gases, in the optical region.
What I have described in this section is certainly not the complete story of dis-
persion in nonconducting media. Nevertheless, it does indicate how the damped
harmonic motion of electrons can account for the frequency dependence of the in-
dex of refraction, and it explains why n is ordinarily a slowly increasing function
of ω, with occasional “anomalous” regions where it precipitously drops.
Problem 9.23
(a) Shallow water is nondispersive; waves travel at a speed that is proportional to
the square root of the depth. In deep water, however, the waves can’t “feel”
all the way down to the bottom—they behave as though the depth were pro-
portional to λ. (Actually, the distinction between “shallow” and “deep” itself
depends on the wavelength: If the depth is less than λ, the water is “shallow”;
if it is substantially greater than λ, the water is “deep.”) Show that the wave
velocity of deep water waves is twice the group velocity.
(b) In quantum mechanics, a free particle of mass m traveling in the x direction is
described by the wave function
(x,t)= Aei (px−Et)/¯ h
,
where p is the momentum, and E= p2/2m is the kinetic energy. Calculate the
group velocity and the wave velocity. Which one corresponds to the classical
speed of the particle? Note that the wave velocity is half the group velocity.
Problem 9.24 If you take the model in Ex. 4.1 at face value, what natural frequency
do you get? Put in the actual numbers. Where, in the electromagnetic spectrum, does
this lie, assuming the radius of the atom is 0.5 Å? Find the coefficients of refraction
and dispersion, and compare them with the measured values for hydrogen at 0◦C
and atmospheric pressure: A= 1.36 × 10−4
, B= 7.7 × 10−15m2
.
Problem 9.25 Find the width of the anomalous dispersion region for the case of
a single resonance at frequency ω0. Assume γ ≪ ω0. Show that the index of re-
fraction assumes its maximum and minimum values at points where the absorption
coefficient is at half-maximum.
Problem 9.26 Starting with Eq. 9.170, calculate the group velocity, assuming there
is only one resonance, at ω0. Use a computer to graph y ≡ vg /c as a function
of x ≡ (ω/ω0)2, from x = 0 to 2, (a) for γ= 0, and (b) for γ= (0.1)ω0. Let
(N q2)/(2mϵ0ω2
0 )= 0.003. Note that the group velocity can exceed c.

9.5 GUIDED WAVES
9.5.1 Wave Guides
So far, we have dealt with plane waves of infinite extent; now we consider elec-
tromagnetic waves confined to the interior of a hollow pipe, or wave guide
(Fig. 9.23). We’ll assume the wave guide is a perfect conductor, so that E= 0
and B= 0 inside the material itself, and hence the boundary conditions at the
inner wall are21
(i) E∥ = 0,
(ii) B⊥
= 0.
(9.175)
Free charges and currents22 will be induced on the surface in such a way as to
enforce these constraints. We are interested in monochromatic waves that propa-
gate down the tube, so E and B have the generic form
(i)
˜
E(x, y, z,t)=

(ii)
B(x, y, z,t)=
˜
E0(x, y)ei (kz−ωt)
,
˜
B0(x, y)ei (kz−ωt)
.
(9.176)
(For the cases of interest, k is real, so I shall dispense with its tilde.) The electric
and magnetic fields must, of course, satisfy Maxwell’s equations, in the interior
of the wave guide:
x
z
y
FIGURE 9.23
21 See Eq. 9.139 and Prob. 7.44. In a perfect conductor, E= 0, and hence (by Faraday’s law)
∂B/∂t = 0; assuming the magnetic field started out zero, then, it will remain so.
22 In Section 9.4.2 I argued that there can be no surface currents in an ohmic conductor (with finite
conductivity). But there are volume currents, extending in (roughly) to the skin depth. As the con-
ductivity increases, they are squeezed into a thinner and thinner layer, and in the limit of a perfect
conductor they become true surface currents.

If Ez = 0, we call these TE (“transverse electric”) waves; if Bz = 0, they are

Indeed, the vector˜
E0 in Eq. 9.178 has zero divergence and zero curl. It can there-
fore be written as the gradient of a scalar potential that satisfies Laplace’s equa-
tion. But the boundary condition on E (Eq. 9.175) requires that the surface be an
equipotential, and since Laplace’s equation admits no local maxima or minima
(Sect. 3.1.4), this means that the potential is constant throughout, and hence the
electric field is zero—no wave at all.
Notice that this argument applies only to a completely empty pipe—if you run a
separate conductor down the middle, the potential at its surface need not be the
same as on the outer wall, and hence a nontrivial potential is possible. We’ll see
an example of this in Sect. 9.5.3.
Problem 9.27
(a) Derive Eqs. 9.179, and from these obtain Eqs. 9.180.
(b) Put Eq. 9.180 into Maxwell’s equations (i) and (ii) to obtain Eq. 9.181. Check
that you get the same results using (i) and (iv) of Eq. 9.179.
24 In the case of TEM waves (including the unconfined plane waves of Sect. 9.2), k= ω/c, Eqs. 9.180
are indeterminate, and you have to go back to Eqs. 9.179.
9.5.2 428 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves
TE Waves in a Rectangular Wave Guide
Suppose we have a wave guide of rectangular shape (Fig. 9.24), with height a
and width b, and we are interested in the propagation of TE waves. The problem
is to solve Eq. 9.181ii, subject to the boundary condition 9.175ii. We’ll do it by
separation of variables. Let
Bz (x, y)= X (x)Y (y),
so that
Y

The general solution to Eq. 9.182i is
X (x)= A sin (kx x) + B cos (kx x).
But the boundary conditions require that Bx —and hence also (Eq. 9.180iii)
d X/d x—vanishes at x = 0 and x = a. So A= 0, and
kx = mπ/a, (m = 0,1,2,... ). (9.184)
The same goes for Y , with
ky = nπ/b, (n = 0,1,2,... ), (9.185)

FIGURE 9.24
9.5 Guided Waves 429
and we conclude that
Bz = B0 cos (mπx/a) cos (nπy/b). (9.186)
This solution is called the TEmn mode. (The first index is conventionally asso-
ciated with the larger dimension, so we assume a ≥ b. By the way, at least one of
the indices must be nonzero—see Prob. 9.28.) The wave number (k) is obtained
by putting Eqs. 9.184 and 9.185 into Eq. 9.183:
k= (ω/c)2
− π2[(m/a)2 + (n/b)2]. (9.187)
If
ω < cπ (m/a)2 + (n/b)2 ≡ ωmn , (9.188)
the wave number is imaginary, and instead of a traveling wave we have expo-
nentially attenuated fields (Eq. 9.176). For this reason, ωmn is called the cutoff
frequency for the mode in question. The lowest cutoff frequency for a given wave
guide occurs for the mode TE10:
ω10 = cπ/a. (9.189)
Frequencies less than this will not propagate at all.
The wave number can be written more simply in terms of the cutoff frequency:

The wave velocity is
v =

which is greater than c. However (see Prob. 9.30), the energy carried by the wave
travels at the group velocity (Eq. 9.150):
vg =
dk/dω
= c 1− (ωmn /ω)2 < c. (9.192)
There’s another way to visualize the propagation of an electromagnetic wave
in a rectangular pipe, and it serves to illuminate many of these results. Con-
sider an ordinary plane wave, traveling at an angle θ to the z axis, and reflect-
ing perfectly off each conducting surface (Fig. 9.25). In the x and y directions,
the (multiply reflected) waves interfere to form standing wave patterns, of wave-
length λx = 2a/m and λy = 2b/n (hence wave number kx = 2π/λx = πm/a
and ky = πn/b), respectively. Meanwhile, in the z direction there remains a trav-
eling wave, with wave number kz = k. The propagation vector for the “original”
plane wave is therefore

The plane wave travels at speed c, but because it is going at an angle θ to the
z axis, its net velocity down the wave guide is
vg = c cos θ= c 1− (ωmn /ω)2
.
The wave velocity, on the other hand, is the speed of the wave fronts ( A, say, in
Fig. 9.25) down the pipe. Like the intersection of a line of breakers with the beach,
they can move much faster than the waves themselves—in fact

Problem 9.28 Show that the mode TE00 cannot occur in a rectangular wave guide.
[Hint: In this case ω/c = k, so Eqs. 9.180 are indeterminate, and you must go back
to Eq. 9.179. Show that Bz is a constant, and hence—applying Faraday’s law in
integral form to a cross section—that Bz = 0, so this would be a TEM mode.]
Problem 9.29 Consider a rectangular wave guide with dimensions 2.28 cm ×
1.01 cm. What TE modes will propagate in this wave guide, if the driving fre-
quency is 1.70 × 1010 Hz? Suppose you wanted to excite only one TE mode; what
range of frequencies could you use? What are the corresponding wavelengths (in
open space)?
Problem 9.30 Confirm that the energy in the TEmn mode travels at the group veloc-
ity. [Hint: Find the time averaged Poynting vector ⟨S⟩ and the energy density ⟨u⟩
(use Prob. 9.12 if you wish). Integrate over the cross section of the wave guide to
get the energy per unit time and per unit length carried by the wave, and take their
ratio.]
9.5 Guided Waves 431
Problem 9.31 Work out the theory of TM modes for a rectangular wave guide. In
particular, find the longitudinal electric field, the cutoff frequencies, and the wave
and group velocities. Find the ratio of the lowest TM cutoff frequency to the lowest
TE cutoff frequency, for a given wave guide. [Caution: What is the lowest TM
mode?]
9.5.3 The Coaxial Transmission Line
In Sect. 9.5.1, I showed that a hollow wave guide cannot support TEM waves.
But a coaxial transmission line, consisting of a long straight wire of radius a,
surrounded by a cylindrical conducting sheath of radius b (Fig. 9.26), does admit
modes with Ez = 0 and Bz = 0. In this case Maxwell’s equations (Eq. 9.179)
yield
k= ω/c (9.193)
(so the waves travel at speed c, and are nondispersive),
c By = Ex and c Bx = −Ey (9.194)
(so E and B are mutually perpendicular), and (together with ∇· E= 0,

the amplitudes by imposing suitable boundary conditions at the two interfaces. All

and that it strikes the glass at normal incidence, find the minimum and maximum
transmission coefficients (Eq. 9.199). You can see the fish clearly; how well can it
see you?
Problem 9.39 According to Snell’s law, when light passes from an optically dense
medium into a less dense one (n1 > n2) the propagation vector k bends away from
the normal (Fig. 9.28). In particular, if the light is incident at the critical angle
θc ≡ sin−1(n2/n1), (9.200)
then θT = 90◦, and the transmitted ray just grazes the surface. If θI exceeds θc ,
there is no refracted ray at all, only a reflected one (this is the phenomenon of total
internal reflection, on which light pipes and fiber optics are based). But the fields

This is a wave propagating in the x direction (parallel to the interface!), and

26 The evanescent fields can be detected by placing a second interface a short distance to the right of
the first; in a close analog to quantum mechanical tunneling, the wave crosses the gap and reassembles
to the right. See F. Albiol, S. Navas, and M. V. Andres, Am. J. Phys. 61, 165 (1993).

(b) Noting that α (Eq. 9.108) is now imaginary, use Eq. 9.109 to calculate the re-
flection coefficient for polarization parallel to the plane of incidence. [Notice
that you get 100% reflection, which is better than at a conducting surface (see,
for example, Prob. 9.22).]

Given ρ(r,t) and J(r,t), what are the fields E(r,t) and B(r,t)? In the static case,
Coulomb’s law and the Biot-Savart law provide the answer. What we’re looking
for, then, is the generalization of those laws to time-dependent configurations.
This is not an easy problem, and it pays to begin by representing the fields
in terms of potentials. In electrostatics ∇ × E= 0 allowed us to write E as the
gradient of a scalar potential: E= −∇V . In electrodynamics this is no longer
possible, because the curl of E is nonzero. But B remains divergenceless, so we
can still write
B= ∇ × A, (10.2)
as in magnetostatics. Putting this into Faraday’s law (iii) yields

Preface
This is a textbook on electricity and magnetism, designed for an undergradu-
ate course at the junior or senior level. It can be covered comfortably in two
semesters, maybe even with room to spare for special topics (AC circuits, nu-
merical methods, plasma physics, transmission lines, antenna theory, etc.) A
one-semester course could reasonably stop after Chapter 7. Unlike quantum me-
chanics or thermal physics (for example), there is a fairly general consensus with
respect to the teaching of electrodynamics; the subjects to be included, and even
their order of presentation, are not particularly controversial, and textbooks differ
mainly in style and tone. My approach is perhaps less formal than most; I think
this makes difficult ideas more interesting and accessible.
For this new edition I have made a large number of small changes, in the in-
terests of clarity and grace. In a few places I have corrected serious errors. I have
added some problems and examples (and removed a few that were not effective).
And I have included more references to the accessible literature (particularly the
American Journal of Physics). I realize, of course, that most readers will not have
the time or inclination to consult these resources, but I think it is worthwhile
anyway, if only to emphasize that electrodynamics, notwithstanding its venerable
age, is very much alive, and intriguing new discoveries are being made all the
time. I hope that occasionally a problem will pique your curiosity, and you will
be inspired to look up the reference—some of them are real gems.
I have maintained three items of unorthodox notation:
• The Cartesian unit vectors are writtenˆ
ˆ
x,
y, andˆ
z (and, in general, all unit
vectors inherit the letter of the corresponding coordinate).
• The distance from the z axis in cylindrical coordinates is designated by s, to
avoid confusion with r (the distance from the origin, and the radial coordi-
nate in spherical coordinates).
• The script letter rdenotes the vector from a source point r′ to the field point r
(see Figure). Some authors prefer the more explicit (r− r′). But this makes
many equations distractingly cumbersome, especially when the unit vector
ˆ
ris involved. I realize that unwary readers are tempted to interpret ras r—it
certainly makes the integrals easier! Please take note: r≡ (r− r′), which is
not the same as r. I think it’s good notation, but it does have to be handled
with care.1

As in previous editions, I distinguish two kinds of problems. Some have a
specific pedagogical purpose, and should be worked immediately after reading
the section to which they pertain; these I have placed at the pertinent point within
the chapter. (In a few cases the solution to a problem is used later in the text;
these are indicated by a bullet (•) in the left margin.) Longer problems, or those
of a more general nature, will be found at the end of each chapter. When I teach
the subject, I assign some of these, and work a few of them in class. Unusually
challenging problems are flagged by an exclamation point (!) in the margin. Many
readers have asked that the answers to problems be provided at the back of the
book; unfortunately, just as many are strenuously opposed. I have compromised,
supplying answers when this seems particularly appropriate. A complete solution
manual is available (to instructors) from the publisher; go to the Pearson web site
to order a copy.
I have benefitted from the comments of many colleagues. I cannot list them
all here, but I would like to thank the following people for especially useful con-
tributions to this edition: Burton Brody (Bard), Catherine Crouch (Swarthmore),
Joel Franklin (Reed), Ted Jacobson (Maryland), Don Koks (Adelaide), Charles
Lane (Berry), Kirk McDonald2 (Princeton), Jim McTavish (Liverpool), Rich
Saenz (Cal Poly), Darrel Schroeter (Reed), Herschel Snodgrass (Lewis and
Clark), and Larry Tankersley (Naval Academy). Practically everything I know
about electrodynamics—certainly about teaching electrodynamics—I owe to
Edward Purcell.

WHAT IS ELECTRODYNAMICS, AND HOW DOES IT FIT INTO THE
GENERAL SCHEME OF PHYSICS?
Four Realms of Mechanics
In the diagram below, I have sketched out the four great realms of mechanics:
Classical Mechanics (Newton) Special Relativity (Einstein) Quantum Mechanics
(Bohr, Heisenberg,
Schrödinger, et al.)
Quantum Field Theory
(Dirac, Pauli, Feynman,
Schwinger, et al.)
Newtonian mechanics is adequate for most purposes in “everyday life,” but for
objects moving at high speeds (near the speed of light) it is incorrect, and must
be replaced by special relativity (introduced by Einstein in 1905); for objects that
are extremely small (near the size of atoms) it fails for different reasons, and is
superseded by quantum mechanics (developed by Bohr, Schrödinger, Heisenberg,
and many others, in the 1920’s, mostly). For objects that are both very fast and
very small (as is common in modern particle physics), a mechanics that com-
bines relativity and quantum principles is in order; this relativistic quantum me-
chanics is known as quantum field theory—it was worked out in the thirties and
forties, but even today it cannot claim to be a completely satisfactory system.
In this book, save for the last chapter, we shall work exclusively in the domain
of classical mechanics, although electrodynamics extends with unique simplic-
ity to the other three realms. (In fact, the theory is in most respects automat-
ically consistent with special relativity, for which it was, historically, the main
stimulus.)
Four Kinds of Forces
Mechanics tells us how a system will behave when subjected to a given force.
There are just four basic forces known (presently) to physics: I list them in the
order of decreasing strength:
xiv
Advertisement xv
1. Strong
2. Electromagnetic
3. Weak
4. Gravitational
The brevity of this list may surprise you. Where is friction? Where is the “normal”
force that keeps you from falling through the floor? Where are the chemical forces
that bind molecules together? Where is the force of impact between two colliding
billiard balls? The answer is that all these forces are electromagnetic. Indeed,
it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that we live in an electromagnetic world—
virtually every force we experience in everyday life, with the exception of gravity,
is electromagnetic in origin.
The strong forces, which hold protons and neutrons together in the atomic nu-
cleus, have extremely short range, so we do not “feel” them, in spite of the fact that
they are a hundred times more powerful than electrical forces. The weak forces,
which account for certain kinds of radioactive decay, are also of short range, and
they are far weaker than electromagnetic forces. As for gravity, it is so pitifully
feeble (compared to all of the others) that it is only by virtue of huge mass con-
centrations (like the earth and the sun) that we ever notice it at all. The electrical
repulsion between two electrons is 1042 times as large as their gravitational at-
traction, and if atoms were held together by gravitational (instead of electrical)
forces, a single hydrogen atom would be much larger than the known universe.
Not only are electromagnetic forces overwhelmingly dominant in everyday
life, they are also, at present, the only ones that are completely understood. There
is, of course, a classical theory of gravity (Newton’s law of universal gravitation)
and a relativistic one (Einstein’s general relativity), but no entirely satisfactory
quantum mechanical theory of gravity has been constructed (though many people
are working on it). At the present time there is a very successful (if cumbersome)
theory for the weak interactions, and a strikingly attractive candidate (called chro-
modynamics) for the strong interactions. All these theories draw their inspiration
from electrodynamics; none can claim conclusive experimental verification at this
stage. So electrodynamics, a beautifully complete and successful theory, has be-
come a kind of paradigm for physicists: an ideal model that other theories emulate.
The laws of classical electrodynamics were discovered in bits and pieces by
Franklin, Coulomb, Ampère, Faraday, and others, but the person who completed
the job, and packaged it all in the compact and consistent form it has today, was
James Clerk Maxwell. The theory is now about 150 years old.
The Unification of Physical Theories
In the beginning, electricity and magnetism were entirely separate subjects. The
one dealt with glass rods and cat’s fur, pith balls, batteries, currents, electrolysis,
and lightning; the other with bar magnets, iron filings, compass needles, and the
North Pole. But in 1820 Oersted noticed that an electric current could deflect
xvi Advertisement
a magnetic compass needle. Soon afterward, Ampère correctly postulated that
all magnetic phenomena are due to electric charges in motion. Then, in 1831,
Faraday discovered that a moving magnet generates an electric current. By the
time Maxwell and Lorentz put the finishing touches on the theory, electricity and
magnetism were inextricably intertwined. They could no longer be regarded as
separate subjects, but rather as two aspects of a single subject: electromagnetism.
Faraday speculated that light, too, is electrical in nature. Maxwell’s theory pro-
vided spectacular justification for this hypothesis, and soon optics—the study
of lenses, mirrors, prisms, interference, and diffraction—was incorporated into
electromagnetism. Hertz, who presented the decisive experimental confirmation
for Maxwell’s theory in 1888, put it this way: “The connection between light
and electricity is now established... In every flame, in every luminous parti-
cle, we see an electrical process... Thus, the domain of electricity extends over
the whole of nature. It even affects ourselves intimately: we perceive that we
possess... an electrical organ—the eye.” By 1900, then, three great branches of
physics–electricity, magnetism, and optics–had merged into a single unified the-
ory. (And it was soon apparent that visible light represents only a tiny “window”
in the vast spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, from radio through microwaves,
infrared and ultraviolet, to x-rays and gamma rays.)
Einstein dreamed of a further unification, which would combine gravity and
electrodynamics, in much the same way as electricity and magnetism had been
combined a century earlier. His unified field theory was not particularly success-
ful, but in recent years the same impulse has spawned a hierarchy of increasingly
ambitious (and speculative) unification schemes, beginning in the 1960s with the
electroweak theory of Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam (which joins the weak and
electromagnetic forces), and culminating in the 1980s with the superstring the-
ory (which, according to its proponents, incorporates all four forces in a single
“theory of everything”). At each step in this hierarchy, the mathematical difficul-
ties mount, and the gap between inspired conjecture and experimental test widens;
nevertheless, it is clear that the unification of forces initiated by electrodynamics
has become a major theme in the progress of physics.
The Field Formulation of Electrodynamics
The fundamental problem a theory of electromagnetism hopes to solve is this: I
hold up a bunch of electric charges here (and maybe shake them around); what
happens to some other charge, over there? The classical solution takes the form
of a field theory: We say that the space around an electric charge is permeated
by electric and magnetic fields (the electromagnetic “odor,” as it were, of the
charge). A second charge, in the presence of these fields, experiences a force; the
fields, then, transmit the influence from one charge to the other—they “mediate”
the interaction.
When a charge undergoes acceleration, a portion of the field “detaches” itself,
in a sense, and travels off at the speed of light, carrying with it energy, momen-
tum, and angular momentum. We call this electromagnetic radiation. Its exis-
Advertisement xvii
tence invites (if not compels) us to regard the fields as independent dynamical
entities in their own right, every bit as “real” as atoms or baseballs. Our interest
accordingly shifts from the study of forces between charges to the theory of the
fields themselves. But it takes a charge to produce an electromagnetic field, and it
takes another charge to detect one, so we had best begin by reviewing the essential
properties of electric charge.
Electric Charge
1. Charge comes in two varieties, which we call “plus” and “minus,” because
their effects tend to cancel (if you have +q and−q at the same point, electrically
it is the same as having no charge there at all). This may seem too obvious to
warrant comment, but I encourage you to contemplate other possibilities: what if
there were 8 or 10 different species of charge? (In chromodynamics there are, in
fact, three quantities analogous to electric charge, each of which may be positive
or negative.) Or what if the two kinds did not tend to cancel? The extraordinary
fact is that plus and minus charges occur in exactly equal amounts, to fantastic
precision, in bulk matter, so that their effects are almost completely neutralized.
Were it not for this, we would be subjected to enormous forces: a potato would
explode violently if the cancellation were imperfect by as little as one part in 1010
.
2. Charge is conserved: it cannot be created or destroyed—what there is now has
always been. (A plus charge can “annihilate” an equal minus charge, but a plus
charge cannot simply disappear by itself—something must pick up that electric
charge.) So the total charge of the universe is fixed for all time. This is called
global conservation of charge. Actually, I can say something much stronger:
Global conservation would allow for a charge to disappear in New York and
instantly reappear in San Francisco (that wouldn’t affect the total), and yet we
know this doesn’t happen. If the charge was in New York and it went to San Fran-
cisco, then it must have passed along some continuous path from one to the other.
This is called local conservation of charge. Later on we’ll see how to formulate a
precise mathematical law expressing local conservation of charge—it’s called the
continuity equation.
3. Charge is quantized. Although nothing in classical electrodynamics requires
that it be so, the fact is that electric charge comes only in discrete lumps—integer
multiples of the basic unit of charge. If we call the charge on the proton +e,
then the electron carries charge−e; the neutron charge zero; the pi mesons +e,
0, and−e; the carbon nucleus +6e; and so on (never 7.392e, or even 1/2e).3
This fundamental unit of charge is extremely small, so for practical purposes it
is usually appropriate to ignore quantization altogether. Water, too, “really” con-
sists of discrete lumps (molecules); yet, if we are dealing with reasonably large
3Actually, protons and neutrons are composed of three quarks, which carry fractional charges (±2
3 e
and ±1
3 e). However, free quarks do not appear to exist in nature, and in any event, this does not alter
the fact that charge is quantized; it merely reduces the size of the basic unit.

quantities of it we can treat it as a continuous fluid. This is in fact much closer to
Maxwell’s own view; he knew nothing of electrons and protons—he must have
pictured charge as a kind of “jelly” that could be divided up into portions of any
size and smeared out at will.
Units
The subject of electrodynamics is plagued by competing systems of units, which
sometimes render it difficult for physicists to communicate with one another. The
problem is far worse than in mechanics, where Neanderthals still speak of pounds
and feet; in mechanics, at least all equations look the same, regardless of the units
used to measure quantities. Newton’s second law remains F= ma, whether it is
feet-pounds-seconds, kilograms-meters-seconds, or whatever. But this is not so in
electromagnetism, where Coulomb’s law may appear variously as
F=
q1q2
ˆ
r (Gaussian), or F=
1
q1q2
ˆ
r (SI), or F=

Of the systems in common use, the two most popular are Gaussian (cgs) and SI
(mks). Elementary particle theorists favor yet a third system: Heaviside-Lorentz.
Although Gaussian units offer distinct theoretical advantages, most undergradu-
ate instructors seem to prefer SI, I suppose because they incorporate the familiar
household units (volts, amperes, and watts). In this book, therefore, I have used
SI units. Appendix C provides a “dictionary” for converting the main results into
Gaussian units.

1.1 VECTOR ALGEBRA
1.1.1 Vector Operations
If you walk 4 miles due north and then 3 miles due east (Fig. 1.1), you will have
gone a total of 7 miles, but you’re not 7 miles from where you set out—you’re
only 5. We need an arithmetic to describe quantities like this, which evidently do
not add in the ordinary way. The reason they don’t, of course, is that displace-
ments (straight line segments going from one point to another) have direction
as well as magnitude (length), and it is essential to take both into account when
you combine them. Such objects are called vectors: velocity, acceleration, force
and momentum are other examples. By contrast, quantities that have magnitude
but no direction are called scalars: examples include mass, charge, density, and
temperature.
I shall use boldface (A, B, and so on) for vectors and ordinary type for scalars.
The magnitude of a vector A is written |A| or, more simply, A. In diagrams, vec-
tors are denoted by arrows: the length of the arrow is proportional to the magni-
tude of the vector, and the arrowhead indicates its direction. Minus A (−A) is a
vector with the same magnitude as A but of opposite direction (Fig. 1.2). Note that
vectors have magnitude and direction but not location: a displacement of 4 miles
due north from Washington is represented by the same vector as a displacement 4
miles north from Baltimore (neglecting, of course, the curvature of the earth). On
a diagram, therefore, you can slide the arrow around at will, as long as you don’t
change its length or direction.
We define four vector operations: addition and three kinds of multiplication.

(i) Addition of two vectors. Place the tail of B at the head of A; the sum,
A + B, is the vector from the tail of A to the head of B (Fig. 1.3). (This rule
generalizes the obvious procedure for combining two displacements.) Addition is
commutative:
A + B= B + A;
3 miles east followed by 4 miles north gets you to the same place as 4 miles north
followed by 3 miles east. Addition is also associative:
(A + B) + C= A + (B + C).
To subtract a vector, add its opposite (Fig. 1.4):
A− B= A + (−B).
(ii) Multiplication by a scalar. Multiplication of a vector by a positive scalar
a multiplies the magnitude but leaves the direction unchanged (Fig. 1.5). (If a is
negative, the direction is reversed.) Scalar multiplication is distributive:
a(A + B)= aA + aB.
(iii) Dot product of two vectors. The dot product of two vectors is defined by
A· B ≡ A B cos θ, (1.1)
where θ is the angle they form when placed tail-to-tail (Fig. 1.6). Note that A· B
is itself a scalar (hence the alternative name scalar product). The dot product is
commutative,
A· B= B· A,
and distributive,
A· (B + C)= A· B + A· C. (1.2)
Geometrically, A· B is the product of A times the projection of B along A (or
the product of B times the projection of A along B). If the two vectors are parallel,
then A· B= A B. In particular, for any vector A,
A· A= A2
. (1.3)
If A and B are perpendicular, then A· B= 0.

or

− 2 A B cos θ.
This is the law of cosines.
(iv) Cross product of two vectors. The cross product of two vectors is de-
fined by
A × B ≡ A B sin θˆ
n, (1.4)
whereˆ
n is a unit vector (vector of magnitude 1) pointing perpendicular to the
plane of A and B. (I shall use a hat (ˆ) to denote unit vectors.) Of course, there
are two directions perpendicular to any plane: “in” and “out.” The ambiguity is
resolved by the right-hand rule: let your fingers point in the direction of the first
vector and curl around (via the smaller angle) toward the second; then your thumb
indicates the direction ofˆ
n. (In Fig. 1.8, A × B points into the page; B × A points
out of the page.) Note that A × B is itself a vector (hence the alternative name
vector product). The cross product is distributive,
A × (B + C)= (A × B) + (A × C), (1.5)
but not commutative. In fact,
(B × A)= −(A × B). (1.6)

Geometrically, |A × B| is the area of the parallelogram generated by A and B
(Fig. 1.8). If two vectors are parallel, their cross product is zero. In particular,
A × A= 0
for any vector A. (Here 0 is the zero vector, with magnitude 0.)
Problem 1.1 Using the definitions in Eqs. 1.1 and 1.4, and appropriate diagrams,
show that the dot product and cross product are distributive,
a) when the three vectors are coplanar;
b) in the general case.
Problem 1.2 Is the cross product associative?
(A × B) × C ?
= A × (B × C).
If so, prove it; if not, provide a counterexample (the simpler the better).
1.1.2 Vector Algebra: Component Form
In the previous section, I defined the four vector operations (addition, scalar mul-
tiplication, dot product, and cross product) in “abstract” form—that is, without
reference to any particular coordinate system. In practice, it is often easier to set
up Cartesian coordinates x, y, z and work with vector components. Letˆ
ˆ
x,
y, and
ˆ
z be unit vectors parallel to the x, y, and z axes, respectively (Fig. 1.9(a)). An
arbitrary vector A can be expanded in terms of these basis vectors (Fig. 1.9(b)):

The numbers Ax , Ay , and Az , are the “components” of A; geometrically, they
are the projections of A along the three coordinate axes ( Ax = A·

Example 1.2. Find the angle between the face diagonals of a cube.

We might as well use a cube of side 1, and place it as shown in Fig. 1.10, with
one corner at the origin. The face diagonals A and B are
A= 1ˆ

So, in component form,
A· B= 1· 0 + 0· 1 + 1· 1= 1.
On the other hand, in “abstract” form,
A· B= A B cos θ= √2√2 cos θ= 2 cos θ.
Therefore,
cos θ= 1/2, or θ= 60◦
.
Of course, you can get the answer more easily by drawing in a diagonal across
the top of the cube, completing the equilateral triangle. But in cases where the
geometry is not so simple, this device of comparing the abstract and component
forms of the dot product can be a very efficient means of finding angles.

1.1.3 Triple Products
Since the cross product of two vectors is itself a vector, it can be dotted or crossed
with a third vector to form a triple product.
(i) Scalar triple product: A· (B × C). Geometrically, |A· (B × C)| is the
volume of the parallelepiped generated by A, B, and C, since |B × C| is the area
of the base, and |A cos θ| is the altitude (Fig. 1.12). Evidently,
A· (B × C)= B· (C × A)= C· (A × B), (1.15)
for they all correspond to the same figure. Note that “alphabetical” order is
preserved—in view of Eq. 1.6, the “nonalphabetical” triple products,
A· (C × B)= B· (A × C)= C· (B × A),
have the opposite sign. In component form,
A· (B × C)=
Ax Ay Az
Cx Cy Cz
Bx By Bz
. (1.16)
Note that the dot and cross can be interchanged:
A· (B × C)= (A × B)· C
(this follows immediately from Eq. 1.15); however, the placement of the parenthe-
ses is critical: (A· B) × C is a meaningless expression—you can’t make a cross
product from a scalar and a vector.

(ii) Vector triple product: A × (B × C). The vector triple product can be
simplified by the so-called BAC-CAB rule:
A × (B × C)= B(A· C)− C(A· B). (1.17)
Notice that
(A × B) × C= −C × (A × B)= −A(B· C) + B(A· C)
is an entirely different vector (cross-products are not associative). All higher vec-
tor products can be similarly reduced, often by repeated application of Eq. 1.17,
so it is never necessary for an expression to contain more than one cross product
in any term. For instance,
(A × B)· (C × D)= (A· C)(B· D)− (A· D)(B· C);
A × [B × (C × D)] = B[A· (C × D)] − (A· B)(C × D). (1.18)

1.1.4 Position, Displacement, and Separation Vectors
The location of a point in three dimensions can be described by listing its
Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z). The vector to that point from the origin (O)
is called the position vector (Fig. 1.13):
r ≡ xˆ

dl= d xˆ
x + d yˆ
y + dzˆ

(We could call this dr, since that’s what it is, but it is useful to have a special
notation for infinitesimal displacements.)
In electrodynamics, one frequently encounters problems involving two
points—typically, a source point, r′, where an electric charge is located, and
a field point, r, at which you are calculating the electric or magnetic field
(Fig. 1.14). It pays to adopt right from the start some short-hand notation for
the separation vector from the source point to the field point. I shall use for this
purpose the script letter r:
r≡ r− r′
. (1.23)
Its magnitude is

1.1.5 How Vectors Transform2
The definition of a vector as “a quantity with a magnitude and direction” is not
altogether satisfactory: What precisely does “direction” mean? This may seem a
pedantic question, but we shall soon encounter a species of derivative that looks
rather like a vector, and we’ll want to know for sure whether it is one.
You might be inclined to say that a vector is anything that has three components
that combine properly under addition. Well, how about this: We have a barrel of
ˆ
ˆ
fruit that contains Nx pears, Ny apples, and Nz bananas. Is N= Nx
x + Ny
y +
ˆ
Nz
z a vector? It has three components, and when you add another barrel with
Mx pears, My apples, and Mz bananas the result is (Nx + Mx ) pears, (Ny + My )
apples, (Nz + Mz ) bananas. So it does add like a vector. Yet it’s obviously not
a vector, in the physicist’s sense of the word, because it doesn’t really have a
direction. What exactly is wrong with it?
The answer is that N does not transform properly when you change coordi-
nates. The coordinate frame we use to describe positions in space is of course
entirely arbitrary, but there is a specific geometrical transformation law for con-
verting vector components from one frame to another. Suppose, for instance, the
x, y, z system is rotated by angle φ, relative to x, y, z, about the common x = x
axes. From Fig. 1.15,
Ay = A cos θ, Az = A sin θ,
while
Ay = A cos θ= A cos(θ− φ)= A(cos θ cos φ + sin θ sin φ)
= cos φAy + sin φAz ,
Az = A sin θ= A sin(θ− φ)= A(sin θ cos φ− cos θ sin φ)
= −sin φAy + cos φAz.

1.1 Vector Algebra 11
We might express this conclusion in matrix notation:
Ay
Az
=
cos φ sin φ
−sin φ cos φ
Ay
Az
. (1.29)
More generally, for rotation about an arbitrary axis in three dimensions, the
transformation law takes the form
⎛ ⎝Ax
Ay
Az
⎞ ⎠= ⎛ ⎝Rx x Rx y Rx z
Ryx Ryy Ryz
Rzx Rzy Rzz
⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝Ax
Ay
Az
⎞ ⎠, (1.30)
or, more compactly,
Ai =
3
j=1
Ri j A j , (1.31)
where the index 1 stands for x, 2 for y, and 3 for z. The elements of the ma-
trix R can be ascertained, for a given rotation, by the same sort of trigonometric
arguments as we used for a rotation about the x axis.
Now: Do the components of N transform in this way? Of course not—it doesn’t
matter what coordinates you use to represent positions in space; there are still just
as many apples in the barrel. You can’t convert a pear into a banana by choosing
a different set of axes, but you can turn Ax into Ay . Formally, then, a vector is
any set of three components that transforms in the same manner as a displace-
ment when you change coordinates. As always, displacement is the model for the
behavior of all vectors.3
By the way, a (second-rank) tensor is a quantity with nine components, Tx x ,
Tx y , Tx z , Tyx , . . . , Tzz , which transform with two factors of R:
T x x = Rx x (Rx x Tx x + Rx y Tx y + Rx z Tx z )
+ Rx y (Rx x Tyx + Rx y Tyy + Rx z Tyz )
+ Rx z (Rx x Tzx + Rx y Tzy + Rx z Tzz ),...
or, more compactly,
T i j =
3
k=1
3
l=1
Ri k R jl Tkl. (1.32)
3If you’re a mathematician you might want to contemplate generalized vector spaces in which the
“axes” have nothing to do with direction and the basis vectors are no longerˆ
ˆ
x,
y, andˆ
z (indeed, there
may be more than three dimensions). This is the subject of linear algebra. But for our purposes all
vectors live in ordinary 3-space (or, in Chapter 12, in 4-dimensional space-time.)
12 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis
In general, an nth-rank tensor has n indices and 3n components, and transforms
with n factors of R. In this hierarchy, a vector is a tensor of rank 1, and a scalar is
a tensor of rank zero.4
Problem 1.8
(a) Prove that the two-dimensional rotation matrix (Eq. 1.29) preserves dot prod-
ucts. (That is, show that Ay B y + Az Bz = Ay By + Az Bz .)
(b) What constraints must the elements (Ri j ) of the three-dimensional rotation ma-
trix (Eq. 1.30) satisfy, in order to preserve the length of A (for all vectors A)?
Problem 1.9 Find the transformation matrix R that describes a rotation by 120◦
about an axis from the origin through the point (1, 1, 1). The rotation is clockwise
as you look down the axis toward the origin.
Problem 1.10
(a) How do the components of a vector5 transform under a translation of coordi-
nates (x = x, y= y− a, z = z, Fig. 1.16a)?
(b) How do the components of a vector transform under an inversion of coordinates
(x = −x, y= −y, z = −z, Fig. 1.16b)?
(c) How do the components of a cross product (Eq. 1.13) transform under inver-
sion? [The cross-product of two vectors is properly called a pseudovector be-
cause of this “anomalous” behavior.] Is the cross product of two pseudovectors
a vector, or a pseudovector? Name two pseudovector quantities in classical me-
chanics.

4A scalar does not change when you change coordinates. In particular, the components of a vector are
not scalars, but the magnitude is.
5Beware: The vector r (Eq. 1.19) goes from a specific point in space (the origin, O) to the point
P= (x, y, z). Under translations the new origin (¯
O) is at a different location, and the arrow from¯
O
to P is a completely different vector. The original vector r still goes from O to P, regardless of the
coordinates used to label these points.
1.2 Differential Calculus 13
1.2 DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
1.2.1 “Ordinary” Derivatives
Suppose we have a function of one variable: f (x). Question: What does the
derivative, d f /d x, do for us? Answer: It tells us how rapidly the function f (x)
varies when we change the argument x by a tiny amount, d x:
d f=
d f
d x
d x. (1.33)
In words: If we increment x by an infinitesimal amount d x, then f changes
by an amount d f ; the derivative is the proportionality factor. For example, in
Fig. 1.17(a), the function varies slowly with x, and the derivative is correspond-
ingly small. In Fig. 1.17(b), f increases rapidly with x, and the derivative is large,
as you move away from x = 0.
Geometrical Interpretation: The derivative d f /d x is the slope of the graph of
f versus x.
1.2.2 Gradient
Suppose, now, that we have a function of three variables—say, the temperature
T (x, y, z) in this room. (Start out in one corner, and set up a system of axes; then
for each point (x, y, z) in the room, T gives the temperature at that spot.) We want
to generalize the notion of “derivative” to functions like T , which depend not on
one but on three variables.
A derivative is supposed to tell us how fast the function varies, if we move a
little distance. But this time the situation is more complicated, because it depends
on what direction we move: If we go straight up, then the temperature will prob-
ably increase fairly rapidly, but if we move horizontally, it may not change much
at all. In fact, the question “How fast does T vary?” has an infinite number of
answers, one for each direction we might choose to explore.
Fortunately, the problem is not as bad as it looks. A theorem on partial deriva-
tives states that
d T=

This tells us how T changes when we alter all three variables by the infinites-
imal amounts d x,d y,dz. Notice that we do not require an infinite number of
derivatives—three will suffice: the partial derivatives along each of the three co-
ordinate directions.
Equation 1.34 is reminiscent of a dot product:

is the gradient of T . Note that ∇T is a vector quantity, with three components;
it is the generalized derivative we have been looking for. Equation 1.35 is the
three-dimensional version of Eq. 1.33.
Geometrical Interpretation of the Gradient: Like any vector, the gradient has
magnitude and direction. To determine its geometrical meaning, let’s rewrite the
dot product (Eq. 1.35) using Eq. 1.1:
d T= ∇T· dl = |∇T ||dl| cos θ, (1.37)
where θ is the angle between ∇T and dl. Now, if we fix the magnitude |dl| and
search around in various directions (that is, vary θ), the maximum change in T
evidentally occurs when θ= 0 (for then cos θ= 1). That is, for a fixed distance
|dl|, d T is greatest when I move in the same direction as ∇T . Thus:
The gradient ∇T points in the direction of maximum increase of the
function T.
Moreover:
The magnitude |∇T | gives the slope (rate of increase) along this
maximal direction.
Imagine you are standing on a hillside. Look all around you, and find the di-
rection of steepest ascent. That is the direction of the gradient. Now measure the
slope in that direction (rise over run). That is the magnitude of the gradient. (Here
the function we’re talking about is the height of the hill, and the coordinates it
depends on are positions—latitude and longitude, say. This function depends on
only two variables, not three, but the geometrical meaning of the gradient is easier
to grasp in two dimensions.) Notice from Eq. 1.37 that the direction of maximum
descent is opposite to the direction of maximum ascent, while at right angles
(θ= 90◦) the slope is zero (the gradient is perpendicular to the contour lines).
You can conceive of surfaces that do not have these properties, but they always
have “kinks” in them, and correspond to nondifferentiable functions.
What would it mean for the gradient to vanish? If ∇T= 0 at (x, y, z),
then d T= 0 for small displacements about the point (x, y, z). This is, then, a
stationary point of the function T (x, y, z). It could be a maximum (a summit),
1.2 Differential Calculus 15
a minimum (a valley), a saddle point (a pass), or a “shoulder.” This is analogous
to the situation for functions of one variable, where a vanishing derivative signals
a maximum, a minimum, or an inflection. In particular, if you want to locate the
extrema of a function of three variables, set its gradient equal to zero.
Example 1.3. Find the gradient of r = x2 + y2 + z2 (the magnitude of the
position vector).

Does this make sense? Well, it says that the distance from the origin increases

is 1. . . just what you’d expect.

and the analogous formula for ∂f /∂z. We know that y= y cos φ + z sin φ and
z = −y sin φ + z cos φ; “solve” these equations for y and z (as functions of y
and z), and compute the needed derivatives ∂y/∂y, ∂z/∂y, etc.]

∇T=

(For once, I write the unit vectors to the left, just so no one will think this means

x/∂x, and so on—which would be zero, sinceˆ
x is constant.) The term in paren-
theses is called del:

Of course, del is not a vector, in the usual sense. Indeed, it doesn’t mean much
until we provide it with a function to act upon. Furthermore, it does not “multiply”
T ; rather, it is an instruction to differentiate what follows. To be precise, then, we
say that ∇ is a vector operator that acts upon T , not a vector that multiplies T .
With this qualification, though, ∇ mimics the behavior of an ordinary vector in
virtually every way; almost anything that can be done with other vectors can also
be done with ∇, if we merely translate “multiply” by “act upon.” So by all means
take the vector appearance of ∇ seriously: it is a marvelous piece of notational
simplification, as you will appreciate if you ever consult Maxwell’s original work
on electromagnetism, written without the benefit of ∇.
Now, an ordinary vector A can multiply in three ways:
1. By a scalar a : Aa;
2. By a vector B, via the dot product: A· B;
3. By a vector B via the cross product: A × B.
Correspondingly, there are three ways the operator ∇ can act:
1. On a scalar function T : ∇T (the gradient);
2. On a vector function v, via the dot product: ∇· v (the divergence);
3. On a vector function v, via the cross product: ∇ × v (the curl).

other two vector derivatives: divergence and curl.

∂vz
∂z. (1.40)
Observe that the divergence of a vector function6 v is itself a scalar ∇· v.
Geometrical Interpretation: The name divergence is well chosen, for ∇· v
is a measure of how much the vector v spreads out (diverges) from the point in
question. For example, the vector function in Fig. 1.18a has a large (positive)
divergence (if the arrows pointed in, it would be a negative divergence), the func-
tion in Fig. 1.18b has zero divergence, and the function in Fig. 1.18c again has a
positive divergence. (Please understand that v here is a function—there’s a differ-
ent vector associated with every point in space. In the diagrams, of course, I can
only draw the arrows at a few representative locations.)
Imagine standing at the edge of a pond. Sprinkle some sawdust or pine needles
on the surface. If the material spreads out, then you dropped it at a point of positive
divergence; if it collects together, you dropped it at a point of negative divergence.
(The vector function v in this model is the velocity of the water at the surface—
this is a two-dimensional example, but it helps give one a “feel” for what the
divergence means. A point of positive divergence is a source, or “faucet”; a point
of negative divergence is a sink, or “drain.”)

Notice that the curl of a vector function7 v is, like any cross product, a vector.
Geometrical Interpretation: The name curl is also well chosen, for ∇ × v is
a measure of how much the vector v swirls around the point in question. Thus
the three functions in Fig. 1.18 all have zero curl (as you can easily check for
yourself), whereas the functions in Fig. 1.19 have a substantial curl, pointing in the
z direction, as the natural right-hand rule would suggest. Imagine (again) you are
standing at the edge of a pond. Float a small paddlewheel (a cork with toothpicks
pointing out radially would do); if it starts to rotate, then you placed it at a point
of nonzero curl. A whirlpool would be a region of large curl.

1.2.6 Product Rules
The calculation of ordinary derivatives is facilitated by a number of rules, such as
the sum rule:
d
d x ( f + g)=
the rule for multiplying by a constant:
d
d x (k f )= k d f
d x,
d f
d x + dg
d x,
the product rule:
d
d x ( f g)= f dg
d x + g
d f
d x,
and the quotient rule:
g
d f
d x− f dg
d x
d
d x
f
g=
g2.
Similar relations hold for the vector derivatives. Thus,
∇( f + g)= ∇ f + ∇g, ∇· (A + B)= (∇· A) + (∇· B),
∇ × (A + B)= (∇ × A) + (∇ × B),
and
∇(k f )= k∇ f, ∇· (kA)= k(∇· A), ∇ × (kA)= k(∇ × A),
as you can check for yourself. The product rules are not quite so simple. There
are two ways to construct a scalar as the product of two functions:
f g A· B (product of two scalar functions),
(dot product of two vector functions),
1.2 Differential Calculus 21
and two ways to make a vector:
f A (scalar times vector),
A × B (cross product of two vectors).
Accordingly, there are six product rules, two for gradients:
(i) ∇( f g)= f ∇g + g∇ f,
(ii) two for divergences:
(iii) ∇(A· B)= A × (∇ × B) + B × (∇ × A) + (A· ∇)B + (B· ∇)A,
∇· ( f A)= f (∇· A) + A· (∇ f ),
(iv) and two for curls:
(v) ∇· (A × B)= B· (∇ × A)− A· (∇ × B),
∇ × ( f A)= f (∇ × A)− A × (∇ f ),
∂
( f Az )
∂z

∂ Az
∂z
(vi) ∇ × (A × B)= (B· ∇)A− (A· ∇)B + A(∇· B)− B(∇· A).
You will be using these product rules so frequently that I have put them inside the
front cover for easy reference. The proofs come straight from the product rule for
ordinary derivatives. For instance,
∇· ( f A)=
∂
∂x
∂
( f Ax ) +
( f Ay ) +
∂y
=
∂f
∂x
∂ Ax

= (∇ f )· A + f (∇· A).
It is also possible to formulate three quotient rules:
∇ f
g=
∇·
A
g=
∇ ×
A
g=
g∇ f− f ∇g
g2.
However, since these can be obtained quickly from the corresponding product
rules, there is no point in listing them separately.

g(∇· A)− A· (∇g)
g2 ,
g(∇ × A) + A × (∇g)

1.2.7 Second Derivatives
The gradient, the divergence, and the curl are the only first derivatives we can
make with ∇; by applying ∇ twice, we can construct five species of second deriva-
tives. The gradient ∇T is a vector, so we can take the divergence and curl of it:
(1) Divergence of gradient: ∇· (∇T ).
(2) Curl of gradient: ∇ × (∇T ).
The divergence ∇· v is a scalar—all we can do is take its gradient:
(3) Gradient of divergence: ∇(∇· v).
The curl ∇ × v is a vector, so we can take its divergence and curl:
(4) Divergence of curl: ∇· (∇ × v).
(5) Curl of curl: ∇ × (∇ × v).
This exhausts the possibilities, and in fact not all of them give anything new.
Let’s consider them one at a time:

1.2 Differential Calculus 23
This object, which we write as ∇2 T for short, is called the Laplacian of T ; we
shall be studying it in great detail later on. Notice that the Laplacian of a scalar
T is a scalar. Occasionally, we shall speak of the Laplacian of a vector, ∇2v. By
this we mean a vector quantity whose x-component is the Laplacian of vx , and
so on:8
∇2v ≡ (∇2vx )ˆ
x + (∇2vy )ˆ
y + (∇2vz )ˆ
z. (1.43)
This is nothing more than a convenient extension of the meaning of ∇2
.
(2) The curl of a gradient is always zero:
∇ × (∇T )= 0. (1.44)
This is an important fact, which we shall use repeatedly; you can easily prove it
from the definition of ∇, Eq. 1.39. Beware: You might think Eq. 1.44 is “obvi-
ously” true—isn’t it just (∇ × ∇)T , and isn’t the cross product of any vector (in
this case, ∇) with itself always zero? This reasoning is suggestive, but not quite
conclusive, since ∇ is an operator and does not “multiply” in the usual way. The
proof of Eq. 1.44, in fact, hinges on the equality of cross derivatives:
∂
∂x
∂T
∂y=
∂
∂y
∂T
∂x. (1.45)
If you think I’m being fussy, test your intuition on this one:
(∇T ) × (∇S).
Is that always zero? (It would be, of course, if you replaced the ∇’s by an ordinary
vector.)
(3) ∇(∇· v) seldom occurs in physical applications, and it has not been given
any special name of its own—it’s just the gradient of the divergence. Notice
that ∇(∇· v) is not the same as the Laplacian of a vector: ∇2v = (∇· ∇)v ̸=
∇(∇· v).
(4) The divergence of a curl, like the curl of a gradient, is always zero:
∇· (∇ × v)= 0. (1.46)
You can prove this for yourself. (Again, there is a fraudulent short-cut proof, using
the vector identity A· (B × C)= (A × B)· C.)
(5) As you can check from the definition of ∇:
∇ × (∇ × v)= ∇(∇· v) − ∇2v. (1.47)
So curl-of-curl gives nothing new; the first term is just number (3), and the sec-
ond is the Laplacian (of a vector). (In fact, Eq. 1.47 is often used to define the
8In curvilinear coordinates, where the unit vectors themselves depend on position, they too must be
differentiated (see Sect. 1.4.1).
24 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis
Laplacian of a vector, in preference to Eq. 1.43, which makes explicit reference
to Cartesian coordinates.)
Really, then, there are just two kinds of second derivatives: the Laplacian
(which is of fundamental importance) and the gradient-of-divergence (which
we seldom encounter). We could go through a similar ritual to work out third
derivatives, but fortunately second derivatives suffice for practically all physical
applications.
A final word on vector differential calculus: It all flows from the operator ∇,
and from taking seriously its vectorial character. Even if you remembered only
the definition of ∇, you could easily reconstruct all the rest.
Problem 1.26 Calculate the Laplacian of the following functions:
(a) Ta = x2 + 2x y + 3z + 4.
(b) Tb = sin x sin y sin z.
(c) Tc = e−5x sin 4y cos 3z.
(d) v = x2ˆ

tion va in Prob. 1.15.

1.3.1 1.3 INTEGRAL CALCULUS
Line, Surface, and Volume Integrals
In electrodynamics, we encounter several different kinds of integrals, among
which the most important are line (or path) integrals, surface integrals (or
flux), and volume integrals.
b
(a) Line Integrals. A line integral is an expression of the form
v· dl, (1.48)
a
where v is a vector function, dl is the infinitesimal displacement vector (Eq. 1.22),
and the integral is to be carried out along a prescribed path P from point a to point
b (Fig. 1.20). If the path in question forms a closed loop (that is, if b= a), I shall
put a circle on the integral sign:
v· dl. (1.49)
At each point on the path, we take the dot product of v (evaluated at that point)
with the displacement dl to the next point on the path. To a physicist, the most
familiar example of a line integral is the work done by a force F: W= F· dl.
Ordinarily, the value of a line integral depends critically on the path taken from
a to b, but there is an important special class of vector functions for which the line

integral is independent of path and is determined entirely by the end points. It will
be our business in due course to characterize this special class of vectors. (A force
that has this property is called conservative.)
Example 1.6. Calculate the line integral of the function v = y2ˆ
x + 2x(y + 1)ˆ
y
from the point a = (1,1,0) to the point b= (2,2,0), along the paths (1) and (2)
in Fig. 1.21. What is v· dl for the loop that goes from a to b along (1) and
returns to a along (2)?
Solution
As always, dl= d xˆ
x + d yˆ
y + dzˆ
z. Path (1) consists of two parts. Along the
“horizontal” segment, d y= dz= 0, so
(i) dl= d xˆ
x, y= 1, v· dl= y2 d x= d x, so v· dl=
2
1 d x= 1.
On the “vertical” stretch, d x= dz= 0, so
(ii) dl= d yˆ
y, x = 2, v· dl= 2x(y + 1)d y= 4(y + 1)d y, so
v· dl= 4
2
(y + 1)d y= 10.

By path (1), then,

v· dl= 1 + 10= 11.
Meanwhile, on path (2) x = y, d x= d y, and dz= 0, so

(The strategy here is to get everything in terms of one variable; I could just as well
have eliminated x in favor of y.)
26 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis
For the loop that goes out (1) and back (2), then,
v· dl= 11− 10= 1.
(b) Surface Integrals. A surface integral is an expression of the form
v· da, (1.50)
S
where v is again some vector function, and the integral is over a specified surface
S. Here da is an infinitesimal patch of area, with direction perpendicular to the
surface (Fig. 1.22). There are, of course, two directions perpendicular to any
surface, so the sign of a surface integral is intrinsically ambiguous. If the surface
is closed (forming a “balloon”), in which case I shall again put a circle on the
integral sign
v· da,
then tradition dictates that “outward” is positive, but for open surfaces it’s arbi-
trary. If v describes the flow of a fluid (mass per unit area per unit time), then
v· da represents the total mass per unit time passing through the surface—
hence the alternative name, “flux.”
Ordinarily, the value of a surface integral depends on the particular surface
chosen, but there is a special class of vector functions for which it is independent
of the surface and is determined entirely by the boundary line. An important task
will be to characterize this special class of functions.

(c) Volume Integrals. A volume integral is an expression of the form
T dτ, (1.51)
V
where T is a scalar function and dτ is an infinitesimal volume element. In Carte-
sian coordinates,
dτ = d x d y dz. (1.52)
For example, if T is the density of a substance (which might vary from point to
point), then the volume integral would give the total mass. Occasionally we shall

closed surface, the positive direction is “outward,” and hence “down,” for the bottom
face.]

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Suppose f (x) is a function of one variable. The fundamental theorem of calcu-
lus says:
b
a
d f
d x
d x= f (b)− f (a). (1.54)
b
In case this doesn’t look familiar, I’ll write it another way:
F(x)d x= f (b)− f (a),
a
where d f /d x= F(x). The fundamental theorem tells you how to integrate F(x):
you think up a function f (x) whose derivative is equal to F.
Geometrical Interpretation: According to Eq. 1.33, d f= (d f /d x)d x is the
infinitesimal change in f when you go from (x) to (x + d x). The fundamental
theorem (Eq. 1.54) says that if you chop the interval from a to b (Fig. 1.25) into
many tiny pieces, d x, and add up the increments d f from each little piece, the
result is (not surprisingly) equal to the total change in f : f (b)− f (a). In other
words, there are two ways to determine the total change in the function: either
subtract the values at the ends or go step-by-step, adding up all the tiny increments
as you go. You’ll get the same answer either way.
Notice the basic format of the fundamental theorem: the integral of a derivative
over some region is given by the value of the function at the end points (bound-
aries). In vector calculus there are three species of derivative (gradient, diver-
gence, and curl), and each has its own “fundamental theorem,” with essentially
the same format. I don’t plan to prove these theorems here; rather, I will explain
what they mean, and try to make them plausible. Proofs are given in Appendix A.
The Fundamental Theorem for Gradients
Suppose we have a scalar function of three variables T (x, y, z). Starting at point
a, we move a small distance dl1 (Fig. 1.26). According to Eq. 1.37, the function
T will change by an amount
d T= (∇T )· dl1.

30 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis
Now we move a little further, by an additional small displacement dl2; the incre-
mental change in T will be (∇T )· dl2. In this manner, proceeding by infinitesimal
steps, we make the journey to point b. At each step we compute the gradient of T
(at that point) and dot it into the displacement dl. . . this gives us the change in T .
Evidently the total change in T in going from a to b (along the path selected) is
b
(∇T )· dl= T (b)− T (a). (1.55)
a
This is the fundamental theorem for gradients; like the “ordinary” fundamental
theorem, it says that the integral (here a line integral) of a derivative (here the
gradient) is given by the value of the function at the boundaries (a and b).
Geometrical Interpretation: Suppose you wanted to determine the height of
the Eiffel Tower. You could climb the stairs, using a ruler to measure the rise at
each step, and adding them all up (that’s the left side of Eq. 1.55), or you could
place altimeters at the top and the bottom, and subtract the two readings (that’s
the right side); you should get the same answer either way (that’s the fundamental
theorem).
Incidentally, as we found in Ex. 1.6, line integrals ordinarily depend on the
path taken from a to b. But the right side of Eq. 1.55 makes no reference to the
path—only to the end points. Evidently, gradients have the special property that
their line integrals are path independent:
Corollary 1: b
a (∇T )· dl is independent of the path taken from a to b.
Corollary 2: (∇T )· dl= 0, since the beginning and end points
are identical, and hence T (b)− T (a)= 0.
Example 1.9. Let T= x y2, and take point a to be the origin (0,0,0) and b the
point (2,1,0). Check the fundamental theorem for gradients.
Solution
Although the integral is independent of path, we must pick a specific path
in order to evaluate it. Let’s go out along the x axis (step i) and then up
(step ii) (Fig. 1.27). As always, dl= d xˆ

1.3.4 The Fundamental Theorem for Divergences
The fundamental theorem for divergences states that:
(∇· v)dτ =
v· da. (1.56)V
S
32 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis
In honor, I suppose, of its great importance, this theorem has at least three special
names: Gauss’s theorem, Green’s theorem, or simply the divergence theorem.
Like the other “fundamental theorems,” it says that the integral of a derivative (in
this case the divergence) over a region (in this case a volume, V) is equal to the
value of the function at the boundary (in this case the surface S that bounds the
volume). Notice that the boundary term is itself an integral (specifically, a surface
integral). This is reasonable: the “boundary” of a line is just two end points, but
the boundary of a volume is a (closed) surface.
Geometrical Interpretation: If v represents the flow of an incompressible fluid,
then the flux of v (the right side of Eq. 1.56) is the total amount of fluid passing out
through the surface, per unit time. Now, the divergence measures the “spreading
out” of the vectors from a point—a place of high divergence is like a “faucet,”
pouring out liquid. If we have a bunch of faucets in a region filled with incom-
pressible fluid, an equal amount of liquid will be forced out through the bound-
aries of the region. In fact, there are two ways we could determine how much is
being produced: (a) we could count up all the faucets, recording how much each
puts out, or (b) we could go around the boundary, measuring the flow at each
point, and add it all up. You get the same answer either way:
(faucets within the volume)= (flow out through the surface).
This, in essence, is what the divergence theorem says.
Example 1.10. Check the divergence theorem using the function
v = y2ˆ
x + (2x y + z2)ˆ
y + (2yz)ˆ

and a unit cube at the origin (Fig. 1.29).

1.3.5 The Fundamental Theorem for Curls
The fundamental theorem for curls, which goes by the special name of Stokes’
theorem, states that
(∇ × v)· da =
v· dl. (1.57)
S
P
As always, the integral of a derivative (here, the curl) over a region (here, a patch
of surface, S) is equal to the value of the function at the boundary (here, the
perimeter of the patch, P). As in the case of the divergence theorem, the boundary
term is itself an integral—specifically, a closed line integral.
Geometrical Interpretation: Recall that the curl measures the “twist” of the
vectors v; a region of high curl is a whirlpool—if you put a tiny paddle wheel
there, it will rotate. Now, the integral of the curl over some surface (or, more
precisely, the flux of the curl through that surface) represents the “total amount
of swirl,” and we can determine that just as well by going around the edge and
finding how much the flow is following the boundary (Fig. 1.31). Indeed, v· dl
is sometimes called the circulation of v.
You may have noticed an apparent ambiguity in Stokes’ theorem: concerning
the boundary line integral, which way are we supposed to go around (clockwise
or counterclockwise)? If we go the “wrong” way, we’ll pick up an overall sign
error. The answer is that it doesn’t matter which way you go as long as you are
consistent, for there is a compensating sign ambiguity in the surface integral:
Which way does da point? For a closed surface (as in the divergence theorem),
da points in the direction of the outward normal; but for an open surface, which
way is “out”? Consistency in Stokes’ theorem (as in all such matters) is given by
the right-hand rule: if your fingers point in the direction of the line integral, then
your thumb fixes the direction of da (Fig. 1.32).
Now, there are plenty of surfaces (infinitely many) that share any given bound-
ary line. Twist a paper clip into a loop, and dip it in soapy water. The soap film
constitutes a surface, with the wire loop as its boundary. If you blow on it, the soap
film will expand, making a larger surface, with the same boundary. Ordinarily, a
flux integral depends critically on what surface you integrate over, but evidently
1.3 Integral Calculus 35
da
=
dl
FIGURE 1.31
FIGURE 1.32
this is not the case with curls. For Stokes’ theorem says that (∇ × v)· da is equal
to the line integral of v around the boundary, and the latter makes no reference to
the specific surface you choose.
Corollary 1: (∇ × v)· da depends only on the boundary line, not
on the particular surface used.
Corollary 2: (∇ × v)· da = 0 for any closed surface, since the
boundary line, like the mouth of a balloon, shrinks
down to a point, and hence the right side of Eq. 1.57
vanishes.
These corollaries are analogous to those for the gradient theorem. We will develop
the parallel further in due course.

y + (4yz2)ˆ

(ii) x = 0, y= 1, v· dl= 4z2 dz, v· dl=

A point of strategy: notice how I handled step (iii). There is a temptation to
write dl= −d yˆ

if you absolutely insist, by running the integral from 0 → 1. But it is much safer
to say dl= d xˆ

rule for derivatives:

That’s integration by parts. It applies to the situation in which you are called upon
to integrate the product of one function ( f ) and the derivative of another (g); it
says you can transfer the derivative from g to f , at the cost of a minus sign and a
boundary term.

We can exploit the product rules of vector calculus, together with the appro-
priate fundamental theorems, in exactly the same way. For example, integrating
∇· ( f A)= f (∇· A) + A· (∇ f )
over a volume, and invoking the divergence theorem, yields
∇· ( f A)dτ = f (∇· A)dτ + A· (∇ f )dτ = f A· da,
or

f (∇· A)dτ = −
V
A· (∇ f )dτ +

Here again the integrand is the product of one function ( f ) and the derivative (in
this case the divergence) of another (A), and integration by parts licenses us to
38 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis
transfer the derivative from A to f (where it becomes a gradient), at the cost of a
minus sign and a boundary term (in this case a surface integral).
You might wonder how often one is likely to encounter an integral involving
the product of one function and the derivative of another; the answer is surpris-
ingly often, and integration by parts turns out to be one of the most powerful tools
in vector calculus.

1.4 CURVILINEAR COORDINATES
1.4.1 Spherical Coordinates
You can label a point P by its Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z), but sometimes it
is more convenient to use spherical coordinates (r,θ,φ); r is the distance from
the origin (the magnitude of the position vector r), θ (the angle down from the
z axis) is called the polar angle, and φ (the angle around from the x axis) is the
azimuthal angle. Their relation to Cartesian coordinates can be read from
Fig. 1.36:
x = r sin θ cos φ, y= r sin θ sin φ, z = r cos θ. (1.62)
ˆ
ˆ
Figure 1.36 also shows three unit vectors,ˆ
r,
θ ,
φ, pointing in the direction of
increase of the corresponding coordinates. They constitute an orthogonal (mutu-
ally perpendicular) basis set (just likeˆ
ˆ
ˆ
x,
y,
z), and any vector A can be expressed
in terms of them, in the usual way:
A= Ar
ˆ
r + Aθ
ˆ
θ + Aφ
ˆ
φ; (1.63)
Ar , Aθ , and Aφ are the radial, polar, and azimuthal components of A. In terms of

But there is a poisonous snake lurking here that I’d better warn you about:
ˆ
ˆ
r,
θ , andˆ
φ are associated with a particular point P, and they change direction
as P moves around. For example,ˆ
r always points radially outward, but “radially
outward” can be the x direction, the y direction, or any other direction, depend-
ing on where you are. In Fig. 1.37, A=
ˆ
ˆ
y and B= −
y, and yet both of them
would be written asˆ
r in spherical coordinates. One could take account of this
ˆ
ˆ
by explicitly indicating the point of reference:ˆ
r(θ,φ),
θ (θ,φ),
φ(θ,φ), but this
would be cumbersome, and as long as you are alert to the problem, I don’t think it
will cause difficulties.9 In particular, do not naïvely combine the spherical compo-
nents of vectors associated with different points (in Fig. 1.37, A + B= 0, not 2ˆ
r,
and A· B= −1, not +1). Beware of differentiating a vector that is expressed in
spherical coordinates, since the unit vectors themselves are functions of position
ˆ
ˆ
(∂ˆ
r/∂θ=
θ , for example). And do not takeˆ
r,
θ , andˆ
φ outside an integral, as I
did withˆ
ˆ
x,
y, andˆ
z in Eq. 1.53. In general, if you’re uncertain about the validity
of an operation, rewrite the problem using Cartesian coordinates, for which this
difficulty does not arise.
An infinitesimal displacement in theˆ
r direction is simply dr (Fig. 1.38a), just
as an infinitesimal element of length in the x direction is d x:
dlr = dr. (1.65)

9I claimed back at the beginning that vectors have no location, and I’ll stand by that. The vectors
themselves live “out there,” completely independent of our choice of coordinates. But the notation we
use to represent them does depend on the point in question, in curvilinear coordinates.

On the other hand, an infinitesimal element of length in theˆ
θ direction (Fig. 1.38b)
is not just dθ (that’s an angle—it doesn’t even have the right units for a length);
rather,
dlθ = r dθ. (1.66)
Similarly, an infinitesimal element of length in theˆ
φ direction (Fig. 1.38c) is
dlφ = r sin θ dφ. (1.67)
Thus the general infinitesimal displacement dl is
dl= drˆ
r + r dθˆ
θ + r sin θ dφ
ˆ
φ. (1.68)
This plays the role (in line integrals, for example) that dl= d xˆ
x + d yˆ
y + dzˆ
z
played in Cartesian coordinates.
The infinitesimal volume element dτ, in spherical coordinates, is the product
of the three infinitesimal displacements:
dτ = dlr dlθ dlφ = r 2 sin θ dr dθ dφ. (1.69)
I cannot give you a general expression for surface elements da, since these depend
on the orientation of the surface. You simply have to analyze the geometry for any
given case (this goes for Cartesian and curvilinear coordinates alike). If you are
integrating over the surface of a sphere, for instance, then r is constant, whereas
θ and φ change (Fig. 1.39), so
da1 = dlθ dlφ
ˆ
r = r 2 sin θ dθ dφˆ
r.
On the other hand, if the surface lies in the x y plane, say, so that θ is constant (to
wit: π/2) while r and φ vary, then
da2 = dlr dlφ
ˆ
θ= r dr dφ
ˆ
θ.
Notice, finally, that r ranges from 0 to ∞, φ from 0 to 2π, and θ from 0 to π
(not 2π—that would count every point twice).10
10Alternatively, you could run φ from 0 to π (the “eastern hemisphere”) and cover the “western hemi-
sphere” by extending θ from π up to 2π. But this is very bad notation, since, among other things,
sin θ will then run negative, and you’ll have to put absolute value signs around that term in volume
and surface elements (area and volume being intrinsically positive quantities).

So far we have talked only about the geometry of spherical coordinates. Now
I would like to “translate” the vector derivatives (gradient, divergence, curl, and
Laplacian) into r , θ, φ notation. In principle, this is entirely straightforward: in

The terms in parentheses could be worked out from Eq. 1.62—or rather, the in-

∂T /∂z. Finally, we’d substitute in the formulas forˆ
ˆ
x,
y, andˆ
z in terms ofˆ
r,
ˆ
θ ,
andˆ
φ (Prob. 1.38). It would take an hour to figure out the gradient in spherical
coordinates by this brute-force method. I suppose this is how it was first done, but
there is a much more efficient indirect approach, explained in Appendix A, which
42 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis
has the extra advantage of treating all coordinate systems at once. I described the
“straightforward” method only to show you that there is nothing subtle or mys-
terious about transforming to spherical coordinates: you’re expressing the same
quantity (gradient, divergence, or whatever) in different notation, that’s all.

At every location, v is directed radially outward (Fig. 1.44); if ever there was a

you actually calculate the divergence (using Eq. 1.71), you get precisely zero:

(You will have encountered this paradox already, if you worked Prob. 1.16.) The
plot thickens when we apply the divergence theorem to this function. Suppose
we integrate over a sphere of radius R, centered at the origin (Prob. 1.38b); the
surface integral is

FIGURE 1.44
46 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis
But the volume integral, ∇· v dτ, is zero, if we are really to believe Eq. 1.84.
Does this mean that the divergence theorem is false? What’s going on here?
The source of the problem is the point r = 0, where v blows up (and where,
in Eq. 1.84, we have unwittingly divided by zero). It is quite true that ∇· v = 0
everywhere except the origin, but right at the origin the situation is more com-
plicated. Notice that the surface integral (Eq. 1.85) is independent of R; if the
divergence theorem is right (and it is), we should get (∇· v)dτ = 4π for any
sphere centered at the origin, no matter how small. Evidently the entire contribu-
tion must be coming from the point r = 0! Thus, ∇· v has the bizarre property
that it vanishes everywhere except at one point, and yet its integral (over any
volume containing that point) is 4π. No ordinary function behaves like that. (On
the other hand, a physical example does come to mind: the density (mass per unit
volume) of a point particle. It’s zero except at the exact location of the particle, and
yet its integral is finite—namely, the mass of the particle.) What we have stum-
bled on is a mathematical object known to physicists as the Dirac delta function.
It arises in many branches of theoretical physics. Moreover, the specific problem
at hand (the divergence of the functionˆ
r/r 2) is not just some arcane curiosity—it
is, in fact, central to the whole theory of electrodynamics. So it is worthwhile to
pause here and study the Dirac delta function with some care.
The One-Dimensional Dirac Delta Function
The one-dimensional Dirac delta function, δ(x), can be pictured as an infinitely

Technically, δ(x) is not a function at all, since its value is not finite at x = 0; in the
mathematical literature it is known as a generalized function, or distribution. It
is, if you like, the limit of a sequence of functions, such as rectangles Rn (x), of
height n and width 1/n, or isosceles triangles Tn (x), of height n and base 2/n
(Fig. 1.46).
If f (x) is some “ordinary” function (that is, not another delta function—in
fact, just to be on the safe side, let’s say that f (x) is continuous), then the product
f (x)δ(x) is zero everywhere except at x = 0. It follows that
f (x)δ(x)= f (0)δ(x). (1.88)
(This is the most important fact about the delta function, so make sure you under-
stand why it is true: since the product is zero anyway except at x = 0, we may as
well replace f (x) by the value it assumes at the origin.) In particular
∞
−∞
f (x)δ(x)d x= f (0)
∞
δ(x)d x= f (0). (1.89)
−∞
Under an integral, then, the delta function “picks out” the value of f (x) at x = 0.
(Here and below, the integral need not run from −∞ to +∞; it is sufficient that
the domain extend across the delta function, and−ϵ to +ϵ would do as well.)
Of course, we can shift the spike from x = 0 to some other point, x = a
(Fig. 1.47):

Solution
The delta function picks out the value of x3 at the point x = 2, so the integral
is 23 = 8. Notice, however, that if the upper limit had been 1 (instead of 3), the
answer would be 0, because the spike would then be outside the domain of inte-
gration.
Although δ itself is not a legitimate function, integrals over δ are perfectly
acceptable. In fact, it’s best to think of the delta function as something that is
always intended for use under an integral sign. In particular, two expressions
involving delta functions (say, D1(x) and D2(x)) are considered equal if 12

δ(kx)=

where k is any (nonzero) constant. (In particular, δ(−x)= δ(x).)
12I emphasize that the integrals must be equal for any f (x). Suppose D1(x) and D2(x) actually
differed, say, in the neighborhood of the point x = 17. Then we could pick a function f (x) that was
sharply peaked about x = 17, and the integrals would not be equal.

For an arbitrary test function f (x), consider the integral
f (x)δ(kx)d x.

Changing variables, we let y ≡ kx, so that x = y/k, and d x= 1/k d y. If k is
positive, the integration still runs from −∞ to +∞, but if k is negative, then
x = ∞ implies y = −∞, and vice versa, so the order of the limits is reversed.

1.5.3 The Three-Dimensional Delta Function
It is easy to generalize the delta function to three dimensions:
δ3(r)= δ(x)δ(y)δ(z). (1.96)
(As always, r ≡ xˆ
x + yˆ
y + zˆ
z is the position vector, extending from the origin
to the point (x, y, z).) This three-dimensional delta function is zero everywhere
except at (0,0,0), where it blows up. Its volume integral is 1:
all space
δ3(r)dτ =
∞
−∞
∞
−∞
∞
δ(x)δ(y)δ(z)d x d y dz= 1. (1.97)
−∞
And, generalizing Eq. 1.92,
all space
f (r)δ3(r− a)dτ = f (a). (1.98)
As in the one-dimensional case, integration with δ picks out the value of the func-
tion f at the location of the spike.
We are now in a position to resolve the paradox introduced in Sect. 1.5.1.
As you will recall, we found that the divergence ofˆ
r/r 2 is zero everywhere ex-
cept at the origin, and yet its integral over any volume containing the origin is a
constant (to wit: 4π). These are precisely the defining conditions for the Dirac
delta function; evidently
∇·
ˆ
r
r 2
= 4πδ3(r). (1.99)
More generally,
∇·
ˆ
r

= 4πδ3(r), (1.100)
where, as always, ris the separation vector: r≡ r− r′. Note that differentiation
here is with respect to r, while r′ is held constant. Incidentally, since

1.5 The Dirac Delta Function (Prob. 1.13b), it follows that

where V is a sphere13 of radius R centered at the origin.

J=
V
(r 2 + 2)4πδ3(r)dτ = 4π(0 + 2)= 8π.
This one-line solution demonstrates something of the power and beauty of the
delta function, but I would like to show you a second method, which is much
more cumbersome but serves to illustrate the method of integration by parts
(Sect. 1.3.6).
Solution 2
Using Eq. 1.59, we transfer the derivative fromˆ
r/r 2 to (r 2 + 2):
J= −

r,
so the volume integral becomes

Meanwhile, on the boundary of the sphere (where r = R),
da = R2 sin θ dθ dφˆ
r,
r dr= 4π R2
.
so the surface integral is
(R2 + 2)sin θ dθ dφ= 4π(R2 + 2).
13In proper mathematical jargon, “sphere” denotes the surface, and “ball” the volume it encloses.
But physicists are (as usual) sloppy about this sort of thing, and I use the word “sphere” for both
the surface and the volume. Where the meaning is not clear from the context, I will write “spherical
surface” or “spherical volume.” The language police tell me that the former is redundant and the latter
an oxymoron, but a poll of my physics colleagues reveals that this is (for us) the standard usage.

(c) What is the volume charge density (in spherical coordinates) of a uniform, in-

1.6 THE THEORY OF VECTOR FIELDS
1.6.1 The Helmholtz Theorem
Ever since Faraday, the laws of electricity and magnetism have been expressed
in terms of electric and magnetic fields, E and B. Like many physical laws,
1.6 The Theory of Vector Fields 53
these are most compactly expressed as differential equations. Since E and B are
vectors, the differential equations naturally involve vector derivatives: divergence
and curl. Indeed, Maxwell reduced the entire theory to four equations, specifying
respectively the divergence and the curl of E and B.
Maxwell’s formulation raises an important mathematical question: To what
extent is a vector function determined by its divergence and curl? In other words,
if I tell you that the divergence of F (which stands for E or B, as the case may be)
is a specified (scalar) function D,
∇· F= D,
and the curl of F is a specified (vector) function C,
∇ × F= C,
(for consistency, C must be divergenceless,
∇· C= 0,
because the divergence of a curl is always zero), can you then determine the
function F?
Well. . . not quite. For example, as you may have discovered in Prob. 1.20, there
are many functions whose divergence and curl are both zero everywhere—the triv-
ial case F= 0, of course, but also F= yzˆ
x + zxˆ
y + x yˆ
z, F= sin x cosh yˆ
x−
cos x sinh yˆ
y, etc. To solve a differential equation you must also be supplied with
appropriate boundary conditions. In electrodynamics we typically require that
the fields go to zero “at infinity” (far away from all charges).14 With that ex-
tra information, the Helmholtz theorem guarantees that the field is uniquely
determined by its divergence and curl. (The Helmholtz theorem is discussed in
Appendix B.)
1.6.2 Potentials
If the curl of a vector field (F) vanishes (everywhere), then F can be written as the
gradient of a scalar potential (V ):
∇ × F= 0 ⇐⇒ F= −∇V. (1.103)
(The minus sign is purely conventional.) That’s the essential burden of the follow-
ing theorem:
Theorem 1
Curl-less (or “irrotational”) fields. The following conditions are equivalent
(that is, F satisfies one if and only if it satisfies all the others):
14In some textbook problems the charge itself extends to infinity (we speak, for instance, of the electric
field of an infinite plane, or the magnetic field of an infinite wire). In such cases the normal boundary
conditions do not apply, and one must invoke symmetry arguments to determine the fields uniquely.
54 Chapter 1 Vector Analysis
(a) ∇ × F= 0 everywhere.
(b) b
a
F· dl is independent of path, for any given end points.
(c) F· dl= 0 for any closed loop.
(d) F is the gradient of some scalar function: F= −∇V.
The potential is not unique—any constant can be added to V with impunity, since
this will not affect its gradient.
If the divergence of a vector field (F) vanishes (everywhere), then F can be
expressed as the curl of a vector potential (A):
∇· F= 0 ⇐⇒ F= ∇ × A. (1.104)
That’s the main conclusion of the following theorem:
Theorem 2
Divergence-less (or “solenoidal”) fields. The following conditions are equivalent:
(a) ∇· F= 0 everywhere.
(b) F· da is independent of surface, for any given boundary line.
(c) F· da = 0 for any closed surface.
(d) F is the curl of some vector function: F= ∇ × A.
The vector potential is not unique—the gradient of any scalar function can be
added to A without affecting the curl, since the curl of a gradient is zero.
You should by now be able to prove all the connections in these theorems, save
for the ones that say (a), (b), or (c) implies (d). Those are more subtle, and will
come later. Incidentally, in all cases (whatever its curl and divergence may be) a
vector field F can be written as the gradient of a scalar plus the curl of a vector:15
F= −∇V + ∇ × A (always). (1.105)

z. Calculate the divergence and curl of
F1 and F2. Which one can be written as the gradient of a scalar? Find a scalar
potential that does the job. Which one can be written as the curl of a vector?
Find a suitable vector potential.
15In physics, the word field denotes generically any function of position (x, y, z) and time (t). But in
electrodynamics two particular fields (E and B) are of such paramount importance as to preempt the
term. Thus technically the potentials are also “fields,” but we never call them that.

2 Electrostatics
2.1 THE ELECTRIC FIELD
2.1.1 Introduction
The fundamental problem electrodynamics hopes to solve is this (Fig. 2.1): We
have some electric charges, q1,q2,q3,... (call them source charges); what force
do they exert on another charge, Q (call it the test charge)? The positions of the
source charges are given (as functions of time); the trajectory of the test particle
is to be calculated. In general, both the source charges and the test charge are in
motion.
The solution to this problem is facilitated by the principle of superposition,
which states that the interaction between any two charges is completely unaffected
by the presence of others. This means that to determine the force on Q, we can first
compute the force F1, due to q1 alone (ignoring all the others); then we compute
the force F2, due to q2 alone; and so on. Finally, we take the vector sum of all
these individual forces: F= F1 + F2 + F3 +... Thus, if we can find the force
on Q due to a single source charge q, we are, in principle, done (the rest is just a
question of repeating the same operation over and over, and adding it all up).1
Well, at first sight this looks very easy: Why don’t I just write down the formula
for the force on Q due to q, and be done with it? I could, and in Chapter 10 I
shall, but you would be shocked to see it at this stage, for not only does the force
on Q depend on the separation distance r between the charges (Fig. 2.2), it also

FIGURE 2.2
1The principle of superposition may seem “obvious” to you, but it did not have to be so simple: if
the electromagnetic force were proportional to the square of the total source charge, for instance, the
principle of superposition would not hold, since (q1 + q2)2
̸= q2
1 + q2
2 (there would be “cross terms”
to consider). Superposition is not a logical necessity, but an experimental fact.
59
60 Chapter 2 Electrostatics
depends on both their velocities and on the acceleration of q. Moreover, it is not
the position, velocity, and acceleration of q right now that matter: electromagnetic
“news” travels at the speed of light, so what concerns Q is the position, velocity,
and acceleration q had at some earlier time, when the message left.
Therefore, in spite of the fact that the basic question (“What is the force on
Q due to q?”) is easy to state, it does not pay to confront it head on; rather, we
shall go at it by stages. In the meantime, the theory we develop will allow for the
solution of more subtle electromagnetic problems that do not present themselves
in quite this simple format. To begin with, we shall consider the special case
of electrostatics in which all the source charges are stationary (though the test
charge may be moving).
2.1.2 Coulomb’s Law
What is the force on a test charge Q due to a single point charge q, that is at rest a
distance r away? The answer (based on experiments) is given by Coulomb’s law:
1
F=
q Q
ˆ
r. (2.1)
4πϵ0
r2
The constant ϵ0 is called (ludicrously) the permittivity of free space. In SI units,
where force is in newtons (N), distance in meters (m), and charge in coulombs (C),
ϵ0 = 8.85 × 10−12 C2
N· m2.
In words, the force is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely
proportional to the square of the separation distance. As always (Sect. 1.1.4), ris
the separation vector from r′ (the location of q) to r (the location of Q):
r= r− r′; (2.2)
r is its magnitude, andˆ
ris its direction. The force points along the line from q to
Q; it is repulsive if q and Q have the same sign, and attractive if their signs are

Coulomb’s law and the principle of superposition constitute the physical input
for electrostatics—the rest, except for some special properties of matter, is math-
ematical elaboration of these fundamental rules.
Problem 2.1
(a) Twelve equal charges, q, are situated at the corners of a regular 12-sided poly-
gon (for instance, one on each numeral of a clock face). What is the net force
on a test charge Q at the center?
(b) Suppose one of the 12 q’s is removed (the one at “6 o’clock”). What is the force
on Q? Explain your reasoning carefully.

(c) Now 13 equal charges, q, are placed at the corners of a regular 13-sided
polygon. What is the force on a test charge Q at the center?

E is called the electric field of the source charges. Notice that it is a function of
position (r), because the separation vectors ri depend on the location of the field
point P (Fig. 2.3). But it makes no reference to the test charge Q. The electric
field is a vector quantity that varies from point to point and is determined by the
configuration of source charges; physically, E(r) is the force per unit charge that
would be exerted on a test charge, if you were to place one at P.
What exactly is an electric field? I have deliberately begun with what you might
call the “minimal” interpretation of E, as an intermediate step in the calculation
of electric forces. But I encourage you to think of the field as a “real” physical

entity, filling the space around electric charges. Maxwell himself came to believe
that electric and magnetic fields are stresses and strains in an invisible primordial
jellylike “ether.” Special relativity has forced us to abandon the notion of ether,
and with it Maxwell’s mechanical interpretation of electromagnetic fields. (It is
even possible, though cumbersome, to formulate classical electrodynamics as an
“action-at-a-distance” theory, and dispense with the field concept altogether.) I
can’t tell you, then, what a field is—only how to calculate it and what it can do
for you once you’ve got it.
Example 2.1. Find the electric field a distance z above the midpoint between
two equal charges (q), a distance d apart (Fig. 2.4a).
Solution
Let E1 be the field of the left charge alone, and E2 that of the right charge alone
(Fig. 2.4b). Adding them (vectorially), the horizontal components cancel and the
vertical components conspire:

2.1.4 Continuous Charge Distributions
Our definition of the electric field (Eq. 2.4) assumes that the source of the field
is a collection of discrete point charges qi . If, instead, the charge is distributed
continuously over some region, the sum becomes an integral (Fig. 2.5a):
E(r)=

If the charge is spread out along a line (Fig. 2.5b), with charge-per-unit-length
λ, then dq= λ dl′ (where dl′ is an element of length along the line); if the
charge is smeared out over a surface (Fig. 2.5c), with charge-per-unit-area σ, then
dq= σ da′ (where da′ is an element of area on the surface); and if the charge fills
a volume (Fig. 2.5d), with charge-per-unit-volume ρ, then dq= ρ dτ′ (where dτ′
is an element of volume):
dq → λ dl′
∼ σ da′

Equation 2.8 itself is often referred to as “Coulomb’s law,” because it is such
a short step from the original (2.1), and because a volume charge is in a sense the
most general and realistic case. Please note carefully the meaning of rin these
formulas. Originally, in Eq. 2.4, ri stood for the vector from the source charge
qi to the field point r. Correspondingly, in Eqs. 2.5–2.8, ris the vector from dq
(therefore from dl′

2.2 DIVERGENCE AND CURL OF ELECTROSTATIC FIELDS
2.2.1 Field Lines, Flux, and Gauss’s Law
In principle, we are done with the subject of electrostatics. Equation 2.8 tells us
how to compute the field of a charge distribution, and Eq. 2.3 tells us what the
force on a charge Q placed in this field will be. Unfortunately, as you may have
discovered in working Prob. 2.7, the integrals involved in computing E can be
formidable, even for reasonably simple charge distributions. Much of the rest of
electrostatics is devoted to assembling a bag of tools and tricks for avoiding these
integrals. It all begins with the divergence and curl of E. I shall calculate the
divergence of E directly from Eq. 2.8, in Sect. 2.2.2, but first I want to show you
a more qualitative, and perhaps more illuminating, intuitive approach.
Let’s begin with the simplest possible case: a single point charge q, situated at
the origin:
1
q
E(r)=
ˆ
r. (2.10)
4πϵ0
r 2
To get a “feel” for this field, I might sketch a few representative vectors, as in
Fig. 2.12a. Because the field falls off like 1/r 2, the vectors get shorter as you go
farther away from the origin; they always point radially outward. But there is a
E
E
(a)
(b)
FIGURE 2.12
2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields 67
nicer way to represent this field, and that’s to connect up the arrows, to form field
lines (Fig. 2.12b). You might think that I have thereby thrown away information
about the strength of the field, which was contained in the length of the arrows.
But actually I have not. The magnitude of the field is indicated by the density of
the field lines: it’s strong near the center where the field lines are close together,
and weak farther out, where they are relatively far apart.
In truth, the field-line diagram is deceptive, when I draw it on a two-dimensional
surface, for the density of lines passing through a circle of radius r is the total
number divided by the circumference (n/2πr ), which goes like (1/r ), not (1/r 2).
But if you imagine the model in three dimensions (a pincushion with needles
sticking out in all directions), then the density of lines is the total number divided
by the area of the sphere (n/4πr 2), which does go like (1/r 2).
Such diagrams are also convenient for representing more complicated fields.
Of course, the number of lines you draw depends on how lazy you are (and how
sharp your pencil is), though you ought to include enough to get an accurate sense
of the field, and you must be consistent: If q gets 8 lines, then 2q deserves 16. And
you must space them fairly—they emanate from a point charge symmetrically in
all directions. Field lines begin on positive charges and end on negative ones;
they cannot simply terminate in midair,4 though they may extend out to infinity.
Moreover, field lines can never cross—at the intersection, the field would have
two different directions at once! With all this in mind, it is easy to sketch the field
of any simple configuration of point charges: Begin by drawing the lines in the
neighborhood of each charge, and then connect them up or extend them to infinity
(Figs. 2.13 and 2.14).
In this model, the flux of E through a surface S,

4If they did, the divergence of E would not be zero, and (as we shall soon see) that cannot happen in

68 Chapter 2 Electrostatics

Equal charges
FIGURE 2.14
is a measure of the “number of field lines” passing through S. I put this in quotes
because of course we can only draw a representative sample of the field lines—the
total number would be infinite. But for a given sampling rate the flux is propor-
tional to the number of lines drawn, because the field strength, remember, is pro-
portional to the density of field lines (the number per unit area), and hence E· da
is proportional to the number of lines passing through the infinitesimal area da.
(The dot product picks out the component of da along the direction of E, as indi-
cated in Fig. 2.15. It is the area in the plane perpendicular to E that we have in
mind when we say that the density of field lines is the number per unit area.)
This suggests that the flux through any closed surface is a measure of the
total charge inside. For the field lines that originate on a positive charge must
either pass out through the surface or else terminate on a negative charge inside
(Fig. 2.16a). On the other hand, a charge outside the surface will contribute
nothing to the total flux, since its field lines pass in one side and out the other
(Fig. 2.16b). This is the essence of Gauss’s law. Now let’s make it quantitative.
In the case of a point charge q at the origin, the flux of E through a spherical
surface of radius r is
E· da =
q

r· (r 2 sin θ dθ dφˆ

FIGURE 2.16
Notice that the radius of the sphere cancels out, for while the surface area goes
up as r 2, the field goes down as 1/r 2, so the product is constant. In terms of the
field-line picture, this makes good sense, since the same number of field lines pass
through any sphere centered at the origin, regardless of its size. In fact, it didn’t
have to be a sphere—any closed surface, whatever its shape, would be pierced by
the same number of field lines. Evidently the flux through any surface enclosing
the charge is q/ϵ0.
Now suppose that instead of a single charge at the origin, we have a bunch of
charges scattered about. According to the principle of superposition, the total field
is the (vector) sum of all the individual fields:
E=
n
i=1
Ei.
The flux through a surface that encloses them all is

where Qenc is the total charge enclosed within the surface. This is the quantita-
tive statement of Gauss’s law. Although it contains no information that was not
already present in Coulomb’s law plus the principle of superposition, it is of al-
most magical power, as you will see in Sect. 2.2.3. Notice that it all hinges on
the 1/r 2 character of Coulomb’s law; without that the crucial cancellation of the
r ’s in Eq. 2.12 would not take place, and the total flux of E would depend on the
surface chosen, not merely on the total charge enclosed. Other 1/r 2 forces (I am
thinking particularly of Newton’s law of universal gravitation) will obey “Gauss’s
laws” of their own, and the applications we develop here carry over directly.
70 Chapter 2 Electrostatics
As it stands, Gauss’s law is an integral equation, but we can easily turn it into
a differential one, by applying the divergence theorem:
E· da =
(∇· E)dτ.

Rewriting Qenc in terms of the charge density ρ, we have

And since this holds for any volume, the integrands must be equal:

Equation 2.14 carries the same message as Eq. 2.13; it is Gauss’s law in differen-
tial form. The differential version is tidier, but the integral form has the advantage
in that it accommodates point, line, and surface charges more naturally.

that the r-dependence is contained in r= r− r′, we have

2.2.3 Applications of Gauss’s Law
I must interrupt the theoretical development at this point to show you the
extraordinary power of Gauss’s law, in integral form. When symmetry permits,
it affords by far the quickest and easiest way of computing electric fields. I’ll
illustrate the method with a series of examples.
Example 2.3. Find the field outside a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius
R and total charge q.
Solution
Imagine a spherical surface at radius r > R (Fig. 2.18); this is called a Gaussian
surface in the trade. Gauss’s law says that
1
E· da =
Qenc,
S
ϵ0
72 Chapter 2 Electrostatics
and in this case Qenc = q. At first glance this doesn’t seem to get us very far,
because the quantity we want (E) is buried inside the surface integral. Luckily,
symmetry allows us to extract E from under the integral sign: E certainly points
radially outward,5 as does da, so we can drop the dot product,
E· da =
|E| da,
S
S
R
r
Gaussian

FIGURE 2.18
and the magnitude of E is constant over the Gaussian surface, so it comes outside
the integral:

|E| da = |E|

da = |E| 4πr 2
.
Thus

|E| 4πr 2

or

Notice a remarkable feature of this result: The field outside the sphere is exactly
the same as it would have been if all the charge had been concentrated at the
center.
Gauss’s law is always true, but it is not always useful. If ρ had not been uniform
(or, at any rate, not spherically symmetrical), or if I had chosen some other shape
for my Gaussian surface, it would still have been true that the flux of E is q/ϵ0, but
E would not have pointed in the same direction as da, and its magnitude would
not have been constant over the surface, and without that I cannot get |E| outside
5If you doubt that E is radial, consider the alternative. Suppose, say, that it points due east, at the
“equator.” But the orientation of the equator is perfectly arbitrary—nothing is spinning here, so there
is no natural “north-south” axis—any argument purporting to show that E points east could just as
well be used to show it points west, or north, or any other direction. The only unique direction on a
sphere is radial.

of the integral. Symmetry is crucial to this application of Gauss’s law. As far as I
know, there are only three kinds of symmetry that work:
1. Spherical symmetry. Make your Gaussian surface a concentric sphere.
2. Cylindrical symmetry. Make your Gaussian surface a coaxial cylinder
(Fig. 2.19).
3. Plane symmetry. Use a Gaussian “pillbox” that straddles the surface
(Fig. 2.20).
Although (2) and (3) technically require infinitely long cylinders, and planes ex-
tending to infinity, we shall often use them to get approximate answers for “long”
cylinders or “large” planes, at points far from the edges.
Example 2.4. A long cylinder (Fig. 2.21) carries a charge density that is propor-
tional to the distance from the axis: ρ = ks, for some constant k. Find the electric
field inside this cylinder.
Solution
Draw a Gaussian cylinder of length l and radius s. For this surface, Gauss’s law
states:
E· da =
Qenc.

(I used the volume element appropriate to cylindrical coordinates, Eq. 1.78, and
integrated φ from 0 to 2π, dz from 0 to l. I put a prime on the integration variable
s′, to distinguish it from the radius s of the Gaussian surface.)
Now, symmetry dictates that E must point radially outward, so for the curved
portion of the Gaussian cylinder we have:
E· da = |E| da = |E| da = |E| 2πsl,
while the two ends contribute nothing (here E is perpendicular to da). Thus,

Solution
Draw a “Gaussian pillbox,” extending equal distances above and below the plane

(Fig. 2.22). Apply Gauss’s law to this surface:
E· da =
Qenc.

In this case, Qenc = σ A, where A is the area of the lid of the pillbox. By symme-
try, E points away from the plane (upward for points above, downward for points
below). So the top and bottom surfaces yield
E· da = 2 A|E|,
whereas the sides contribute nothing. Thus

n is a unit vector pointing away from the surface. In Prob. 2.6, you obtained
this same result by a much more laborious method.
It seems surprising, at first, that the field of an infinite plane is independent of
how far away you are. What about the 1/r 2 in Coulomb’s law? The point is that as
you move farther and farther away from the plane, more and more charge comes
into your “field of view” (a cone shape extending out from your eye), and this
compensates for the diminishing influence of any particular piece. The electric
field of a sphere falls off like 1/r 2; the electric field of an infinite line falls off like
1/r ; and the electric field of an infinite plane does not fall off at all (you cannot
escape from an infinite plane).
Although the direct use of Gauss’s law to compute electric fields is limited to
cases of spherical, cylindrical, and planar symmetry, we can put together combi-
nations of objects possessing such symmetry, even though the arrangement as a
whole is not symmetrical. For example, invoking the principle of superposition,
we could find the field in the vicinity of two uniformly charged parallel cylinders,
or a sphere near an infinite charged plane.
Example 2.6. Two infinite parallel planes carry equal but opposite uniform
charge densities ±σ (Fig. 2.23). Find the field in each of the three regions: (i)
to the left of both, (ii) between them, (iii) to the right of both.
Solution
The left plate produces a field (1/2ϵ0)σ, which points away from it (Fig. 2.24)—
to the left in region (i) and to the right in regions (ii) and (iii). The right plate,
being negatively charged, produces a field (1/2ϵ0)σ, which points toward it—to
the right in regions (i) and (ii) and to the left in region (iii). The two fields cancel
in regions (i) and (iii); they conspire in region (ii). Conclusion: The field between
the plates is σ/ϵ0, and points to the right; elsewhere it is zero.

Now, a glance at Fig. 2.12 should convince you that the curl of this field has to

some other point b (Fig. 2.29):

The integral around a closed path is evidently zero (for then ra = rb):
E· dl= 0, (2.19)
and hence, applying Stokes’ theorem,
∇ × E= 0. (2.20)
Now, I proved Eqs. 2.19 and 2.20 only for the field of a single point charge
at the origin, but these results make no reference to what is, after all, a perfectly
arbitrary choice of coordinates; they hold no matter where the charge is located.
Moreover, if we have many charges, the principle of superposition states that the
total field is a vector sum of their individual fields:
E= E1 + E2 + . . . ,
so
∇ × E= ∇ × (E1 + E2 + ...)= (∇ × E1) + (∇ × E2) +...
= 0.
Thus, Eqs. 2.19 and 2.20 hold for any static charge distribution whatever.
Problem 2.19 Calculate ∇ × E directly from Eq. 2.8, by the method of Sect. 2.2.2.
Refer to Prob. 1.63 if you get stuck.
2.3 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL
2.3.1 Introduction to Potential
The electric field E is not just any old vector function. It is a very special kind of
vector function: one whose curl is zero. E= yˆ
x, for example, could not possibly
be an electrostatic field; no set of charges, regardless of their sizes and positions,
could ever produce such a field. We’re going to exploit this special property of
electric fields to reduce a vector problem (finding E) to a much simpler scalar
problem. The first theorem in Sect. 1.6.2 asserts that any vector whose curl is zero
is equal to the gradient of some scalar. What I’m going to do now amounts to a
proof of that claim, in the context of electrostatics.
2.3 Electric Potential 79

FIGURE 2.30
Because ∇ × E= 0, the line integral of E around any closed loop is zero (that
follows from Stokes’ theorem). Because E· dl= 0, the line integral of E from
point a to point b is the same for all paths (otherwise you could go out along path
(i) and return along path (ii)—Fig. 2.30—and obtain E· dl ̸= 0). Because the
line integral is independent of path, we can define a function6
V (r) ≡ −
r
O
E· dl. (2.21)
Here O is some standard reference point on which we have agreed beforehand; V
then depends only on the point r. It is called the electric potential.
The potential difference between two points a and b is
V (b)− V (a)= −

V (b)− V (a)=

(∇V )· dl,
so

(∇V )· dl= −

E· dl.
Since, finally, this is true for any points a and b, the integrands must be equal:
E= −∇V. (2.23)
6To avoid any possible ambiguity, I should perhaps put a prime on the integration variable:
V (r)= −
r
O
E(r′)· dl′
.
But this makes for cumbersome notation, and I prefer whenever possible to reserve the primes for
source points. However, when (as in Ex. 2.7) we calculate such integrals explicitly, I will put in the
primes.
80 Chapter 2 Electrostatics
Equation 2.23 is the differential version of Eq. 2.21; it says that the electric field
is the gradient of a scalar potential, which is what we set out to prove.
Notice the subtle but crucial role played by path independence (or, equiva-
lently, the fact that ∇ × E= 0) in this argument. If the line integral of E depended
on the path taken, then the “definition” of V , Eq. 2.21, would be nonsense. It sim-
ply would not define a function, since changing the path would alter the value of
V (r). By the way, don’t let the minus sign in Eq. 2.23 distract you; it carries over
from Eq. 2.21 and is largely a matter of convention.
Problem 2.20 One of these is an impossible electrostatic field. Which one?
(a) E= k[x yˆ
x + 2yzˆ
y + 3x zˆ
z];
(b) E= k[y2ˆ
x + (2x y + z2)ˆ
y + 2yzˆ
z].
Here k is a constant with the appropriate units. For the possible one, find the poten-
tial, using the origin as your reference point. Check your answer by computing ∇V.
[Hint: You must select a specific path to integrate along. It doesn’t matter what path
you choose, since the answer is path-independent, but you simply cannot integrate
unless you have a definite path in mind.]
2.3.2 Comments on Potential
(i) The name. The word “potential” is a hideous misnomer because it inevitably
reminds you of potential energy. This is particularly insidious, because there
is a connection between “potential” and “potential energy,” as you will see in
Sect. 2.4. I’m sorry that it is impossible to escape this word. The best I can do is
to insist once and for all that “potential” and “potential energy” are completely
different terms and should, by all rights, have different names. Incidentally, a sur-
face over which the potential is constant is called an equipotential.
(ii) Advantage of the potential formulation. If you know V , you can eas-
ily get E—just take the gradient: E= −∇V . This is quite extraordinary when
you stop to think about it, for E is a vector quantity (three components), but V
is a scalar (one component). How can one function possibly contain all the in-
formation that three independent functions carry? The answer is that the three
components of E are not really as independent as they look; in fact, they are ex-
plicitly interrelated by the very condition we started with, ∇ × E= 0. In terms of
components,
∂Ey

∂Ex
∂Ez
∂Ex
∂y=
,
∂x
∂Ez
∂y=
=
,
∂z
∂z
∂x.
This brings us back to my observation at the beginning of Sect. 2.3.1: E is a very
special kind of vector. What the potential formulation does is to exploit this feature
to maximum advantage, reducing a vector problem to a scalar one, in which there
is no need to fuss with components.
2.3 Electric Potential 81
(iii) The reference point O. There is an essential ambiguity in the definition of
potential, since the choice of reference point O was arbitrary. Changing reference
points amounts to adding a constant K to the potential:
V ′(r)= −
r
O′
E· dl= −
O
O′
E· dl−
r
O
E· dl= K + V (r),
where K is the line integral of E from the old reference point O to the new one O′
.
Of course, adding a constant to V will not affect the potential difference between
two points:
V ′(b)− V ′(a)= V (b)− V (a),
since the K ’s cancel out. (Actually, it was already clear from Eq. 2.22 that the
potential difference is independent of O, because it can be written as the line
integral of E from a to b, with no reference to O.) Nor does the ambiguity affect
the gradient of V :
∇V ′
= ∇V ,
since the derivative of a constant is zero. That’s why all such V ’s, differing only
in their choice of reference point, correspond to the same field E.
Potential as such carries no real physical significance, for at any given point
we can adjust its value at will by a suitable relocation of O. In this sense, it is
rather like altitude: If I ask you how high Denver is, you will probably tell me
its height above sea level, because that is a convenient and traditional reference
point. But we could as well agree to measure altitude above Washington, D.C.,
or Greenwich, or wherever. That would add (or, rather, subtract) a fixed amount
from all our sea-level readings, but it wouldn’t change anything about the real
world. The only quantity of intrinsic interest is the difference in altitude between
two points, and that is the same whatever your reference level.
Having said this, however, there is a “natural” spot to use for O in
electrostatics—analogous to sea level for altitude—and that is a point infinitely
far from the charge. Ordinarily, then, we “set the zero of potential at infinity.”
(Since V (O)= 0, choosing a reference point is equivalent to selecting a place
where V is to be zero.) But I must warn you that there is one special circum-
stance in which this convention fails: when the charge distribution itself extends
to infinity. The symptom of trouble, in such cases, is that the potential blows up.
For instance, the field of a uniformly charged plane is (σ/2ϵ0)ˆ
n, as we found in
Ex. 2.5; if we naïvely put O = ∞, then the potential at height z above the plane
becomes
1
1
V (z)= −
z
∞
σ dz= −
σ(z − ∞).
2ϵ0
2ϵ0
The remedy is simply to choose some other reference point (in this example you
might use a point on the plane). Notice that the difficulty occurs only in textbook
problems; in “real life” there is no such thing as a charge distribution that goes on
forever, and we can always use infinity as our reference point.
82 Chapter 2 Electrostatics
(iv) Potential obeys the superposition principle. The original superposition
principle pertains to the force on a test charge Q. It says that the total force on Q
is the vector sum of the forces attributable to the source charges individually:
F= F1 + F2 +...
Dividing through by Q, we see that the electric field, too, obeys the superposition
principle:
E= E1 + E2 +...
Integrating from the common reference point to r, it follows that the potential also
satisfies such a principle:
V= V1 + V2 +...
That is, the potential at any given point is the sum of the potentials due to all the
source charges separately. Only this time it is an ordinary sum, not a vector sum,
which makes it a lot easier to work with.
(v) Units of Potential. In our units, force is measured in newtons and charge
in coulombs, so electric fields are in newtons per coulomb. Accordingly, potential
is newton-meters per coulomb, or joules per coulomb. A joule per coulomb is
a volt.

Notice that the potential is not zero inside the shell, even though the field is.
V is a constant in this region, to be sure, so that ∇V= 0—that’s what matters.
In problems of this type, you must always work your way in from the reference
point; that’s where the potential is “nailed down.” It is tempting to suppose that
you could figure out the potential inside the sphere on the basis of the field there
alone, but this is false: The potential inside the sphere is sensitive to what’s going
on outside the sphere as well. If I placed a second uniformly charged shell out at
radius R′ > R, the potential inside R would change, even though the field would
still be zero. Gauss’s law guarantees that charge exterior to a given point (that
is, at larger r ) produces no net field at that point, provided it is spherically or
cylindrically symmetric, but there is no such rule for potential, when infinity is
used as the reference point.
Problem 2.21 Find the potential inside and outside a uniformly charged solid sphere
whose radius is R and whose total charge is q. Use infinity as your reference point.

center, using infinity as your reference point.
Problem 2.24 For the configuration of Prob. 2.16, find the potential difference
between a point on the axis and a point on the outer cylinder. Note that it is not
necessary to commit yourself to a particular reference point, if you use Eq. 2.22.
2.3.3 Poisson’s Equation and Laplace’s Equation
We found in Sect. 2.3.1 that the electric field can be written as the gradient of a
scalar potential.
E= −∇V.
The question arises: What do the divergence and curl of E,
ρ
∇· E=
and ∇ × E= 0,
ϵ0
84 Chapter 2 Electrostatics
look like, in terms of V ? Well, ∇· E= ∇· (−∇V ) = −∇2 V , so, apart from that
persistent minus sign, the divergence of E is the Laplacian of V . Gauss’s law,
then, says
∇2 V= −
ρ
. (2.24)
2.3.4 ϵ0
This is known as Poisson’s equation. In regions where there is no charge, so
ρ = 0, Poisson’s equation reduces to Laplace’s equation,
∇2 V= 0. (2.25)
We’ll explore this equation more fully in Chapter 3.
So much for Gauss’s law. What about the curl law? This says that
∇ × E= ∇ × (−∇V )= 0.
But that’s no condition on V —curl of gradient is always zero. Of course, we
used the curl law to show that E could be expressed as the gradient of a scalar,
so it’s not really surprising that this works out: ∇ × E= 0 permits E= −∇V ;
in return, E= −∇V guarantees ∇ × E= 0. It takes only one differential equa-
tion (Poisson’s) to determine V , because V is a scalar; for E we needed two, the
divergence and the curl.
The Potential of a Localized Charge Distribution
I defined V in terms of E (Eq. 2.21). Ordinarily, though, it’s E that we’re looking
for (if we already knew E, there wouldn’t be much point in calculating V ). The
idea is that it might be easier to get V first, and then calculate E by taking the
gradient. Typically, then, we know where the charge is (that is, we know ρ), and
we want to find V . Now, Poisson’s equation relates V and ρ, but unfortunately
it’s “the wrong way around”: it would give us ρ, if we knew V , whereas we want
V , knowing ρ. What we must do, then, is “invert” Poisson’s equation. That’s the
program for this section, although I shall do it by roundabout means, beginning,
as always, with a point charge at the origin.

minus sign in the definition (Eq. 2.21) was chosen in order to make the poten-
tial of a positive charge come out positive. It is useful to remember that regions
of positive charge are potential “hills,” regions of negative charge are potential
“valleys,” and the electric field points “downhill,” from plus toward minus.

2.3.5 Boundary Conditions
In the typical electrostatic problem you are given a source charge distribution
ρ, and you want to find the electric field E it produces. Unless the symmetry
of the problem allows a solution by Gauss’s law, it is generally to your advan-
tage to calculate the potential first, as an intermediate step. These are the three
fundamental quantities of electrostatics: ρ, E, and V . We have, in the course
of our discussion, derived all six formulas interrelating them. These equations
are neatly summarized in Fig. 2.35. We began with just two experimental obser-
vations: (1) the principle of superposition—a broad general rule applying to all
electromagnetic forces, and (2) Coulomb’s law—the fundamental law of electro-
statics. From these, all else followed.
You may have noticed, in studying Exs. 2.5 and 2.6, or working problems such
as 2.7, 2.11, and 2.16, that the electric field always undergoes a discontinuity
when you cross a surface charge σ. In fact, it is a simple matter to find the amount
by which E changes at such a boundary. Suppose we draw a wafer-thin Gaussian
pillbox, extending just barely over the edge in each direction (Fig. 2.36). Gauss’s
law says that

tency, we let “upward” be the positive direction for both. Conclusion: The normal
component of E is discontinuous by an amount σ/ϵ0 at any boundary. In partic-
ular, where there is no surface charge, E⊥ is continuous, as for instance at the
surface of a uniformly charged solid sphere.
The tangential component of E, by contrast, is always continuous. For if we
apply Eq. 2.19,
E· dl= 0,
to the thin rectangular loop of Fig. 2.37, the ends give nothing (as ϵ → 0), and
the sides give (E∥

E∥

where E∥ stands for the components of E parallel to the surface. The boundary
conditions on E (Eqs. 2.31 and 2.32) can be combined into a single formula:

as the path length shrinks to zero, so too does the integral:

Please note that these boundary conditions relate the fields and potentials just

limiting values as we approach the surface from either side.
8Notice that it doesn’t matter which side you call “above” and which “below,” since reversal would
switch the direction ofˆ
n. Incidentally, if you’re only interested in the field due to the (essentially
flat) local patch of surface charge itself, the answer is (σ/2ϵ0)ˆ
n immediately above the surface, and
−(σ/2ϵ0)ˆ
n immediately below. This follows from Ex. 2.5, for if you are close enough to the patch it
“looks” like an infinite plane. Evidently the entire discontinuity in E is attributable to this local patch
of surface charge.

2.4 2.4.1 WORK AND ENERGY IN ELECTROSTATICS
The Work It Takes to Move a Charge
Suppose you have a stationary configuration of source charges, and you want to
move a test charge Q from point a to point b (Fig. 2.39). Question: How much
work will you have to do? At any point along the path, the electric force on Q is
F= QE; the force you must exert, in opposition to this electrical force, is−QE.
(If the sign bothers you, think about lifting a brick: gravity exerts a force mg
downward, but you exert a force mg upward. Of course, you could apply an even
greater force—then the brick would accelerate, and part of your effort would be
“wasted” generating kinetic energy. What we’re interested in here is the minimum
force you must exert to do the job.) The work you do is therefore
W=
b
a
F· dl= −Q
b
E· dl= Q[V (b)− V (a)].
a
Notice that the answer is independent of the path you take from a to b; in mechan-
ics, then, we would call the electrostatic force “conservative.” Dividing through
by Q, we have
W
V (b)− V (a)=
Q. (2.38)
In words, the potential difference between points a and b is equal to the work per
unit charge required to carry a particle from a to b. In particular, if you want to
bring Q in from far away and stick it at point r, the work you must do is
W= Q[V (r)− V (∞)],

FIGURE 2.39
2.4.2 92 Chapter 2 Electrostatics
so, if you have set the reference point at infinity,
W= QV (r). (2.39)
In this sense, potential is potential energy (the work it takes to create the system)
per unit charge (just as the field is the force per unit charge).
The Energy of a Point Charge Distribution
How much work would it take to assemble an entire collection of point charges?
Imagine bringing in the charges, one by one, from far away (Fig. 2.40). The first
charge, q1, takes no work, since there is no field yet to fight against. Now bring in
q2. According to Eq. 2.39, this will cost you q2 V1(r2), where V1 is the potential
due to q1, and r2 is the place we’re putting q2:
W2 =
1
4πϵ0
q2
q1
r12
(r12 is the distance between q1 and q2 once they are in position). As you bring in
each charge, nail it down in its final location, so it doesn’t move when you bring
in the next charge. Now bring in q3; this requires work q3 V1,2(r3), where V1,2 is
the potential due to charges q1 and q2, namely, (1/4πϵ0)(q1/r13 + q2/r23). Thus
W3 =

Similarly, the extra work to bring in q4 will be

their separation distance, and add it all up:

The stipulation j > i is to remind you not to count the same pair twice. A nicer
way to accomplish this is intentionally to count each pair twice, and then divide
by 2:

That’s how much work it takes to assemble a configuration of point charges; it’s
also the amount of work you’d get back if you dismantled the system. In the
meantime, it represents energy stored in the configuration (“potential” energy, if
you insist, though for obvious reasons I prefer to avoid that word in this context).

far apart?

Find the work per particle required to assemble this system. [Partial Answer:

It is known as the Madelung constant. Calculating the Madelung constant for
2- and 3-dimensional arrays is much more subtle and difficult.]
2.4.3 The Energy of a Continuous Charge Distribution
For a volume charge density ρ, Eq. 2.42 becomes
W=
1
2 ρV dτ. (2.43)
(The corresponding integrals for line and surface charges would be λV dl and
σV da.) There is a lovely way to rewrite this result, in which ρ and V are
eliminated in favor of E. First use Gauss’s law to express ρ in terms of E:
ρ = ϵ0∇· E, so W=
ϵ0
2 (∇· E)V dτ.
Now use integration by parts (Eq. 1.59) to transfer the derivative from E to V :
W=
ϵ0
2− E· (∇V )dτ + V E· da.
But ∇V= −E, so
2
W=
ϵ0
⎛ ⎝V
E2 dτ +
S
V E· da⎞ ⎠. (2.44)
But what volume is this we’re integrating over? Let’s go back to the formula
we started with, Eq. 2.43. From its derivation, it is clear that we should integrate
over the region where the charge is located. But actually, any larger volume would
do just as well: The “extra” territory we throw in will contribute nothing to the
integral, since ρ = 0 out there. With this in mind, we return to Eq. 2.44. What
happens here, as we enlarge the volume beyond the minimum necessary to trap
all the charge? Well, the integral of E2 can only increase (the integrand being
positive); evidently the surface integral must decrease correspondingly to leave
the sum intact. (In fact, at large distances from the charge, E goes like 1/r 2 and V
like 1/r , while the surface area grows like r 2; roughly speaking, then, the surface
integral goes down like 1/r .) Please understand: Eq. 2.44 gives you the correct
2.4 Work and Energy in Electrostatics 95
energy W , whatever volume you use (as long as it encloses all the charge), but
the contribution from the volume integral goes up, and that of the surface integral
goes down, as you take larger and larger volumes. In particular, why not integrate
over all space? Then the surface integral goes to zero, and we are left with

Problem 2.35 Here is a fourth way of computing the energy of a uniformly charged
solid sphere: Assemble it like a snowball, layer by layer, each time bringing in an
infinitesimal charge dq from far away and smearing it uniformly over the surface,
thereby increasing the radius. How much work d W does it take to build up the radius
by an amount dr ? Integrate this to find the work necessary to create the entire sphere
of radius R and total charge q.
2.4.4 Comments on Electrostatic Energy
(i) A perplexing “inconsistency.” Equation 2.45 clearly implies that the
energy of a stationary charge distribution is always positive. On the other hand,
Eq. 2.42 (from which 2.45 was in fact derived), can be positive or negative. For
instance, according to Eq. 2.42, the energy of two equal but opposite charges a
distance r apart is−(1/4πϵ0)(q2/r). What’s gone wrong? Which equation is cor-
rect?
The answer is that both are correct, but they speak to slightly different ques-
tions. Equation 2.42 does not take into account the work necessary to make the
point charges in the first place; we started with point charges and simply found
the work required to bring them together. This is wise strategy, since Eq. 2.45
indicates that the energy of a point charge is in fact infinite:
W=
ϵ0
2(4πϵ0)2
q2
r 4 (r 2 sin θ dr dθ dφ)=
q2
8πϵ0
∞
0
1
r 2 dr = ∞.
Equation 2.45 is more complete, in the sense that it tells you the total energy
stored in a charge configuration, but Eq. 2.42 is more appropriate when you’re
dealing with point charges, because we prefer (for good reason!) to leave out that
portion of the total energy that is attributable to the fabrication of the point charges
themselves. In practice, after all, the point charges (electrons, say) are given to us
ready-made; all we do is move them around. Since we did not put them together,
and we cannot take them apart, it is immaterial how much work the process would
involve. (Still, the infinite energy of a point charge is a recurring source of embar-
rassment for electromagnetic theory, afflicting the quantum version as well as the
classical. We shall return to the problem in Chapter 11.)
Now, you may wonder where the inconsistency crept into an apparently water-
tight derivation. The “flaw” lies between Eqs. 2.42 and 2.43: in the former, V (ri )
represents the potential due to all the other charges but not qi , whereas in the
latter, V (r) is the full potential. For a continuous distribution, there is no distinc-
tion, since the amount of charge right at the point r is vanishingly small, and its
contribution to the potential is zero. But in the presence of point charges you’d
better stick with Eq. 2.42.
(ii) Where is the energy stored? Equations 2.43 and 2.45 offer two different
ways of calculating the same thing. The first is an integral over the charge dis-
tribution; the second is an integral over the field. These can involve completely
different regions. For instance, in the case of the spherical shell (Ex. 2.9) the
charge is confined to the surface, whereas the electric field is everywhere outside
2.5 Conductors 97
this surface. Where is the energy, then? Is it stored in the field, as Eq. 2.45 seems
to suggest, or is it stored in the charge, as Eq. 2.43 implies? At the present stage
this is simply an unanswerable question: I can tell you what the total energy is,
and I can provide you with several different ways to compute it, but it is imperti-
nent to worry about where the energy is located. In the context of radiation theory
(Chapter 11) it is useful (and in general relativity it is essential) to regard the
energy as stored in the field, with a density
ϵ0
2
E2
= energy per unit volume. (2.46)
But in electrostatics one could just as well say it is stored in the charge, with a
density 1
2 ρV . The difference is purely a matter of bookkeeping.
(iii) The superposition principle. Because electrostatic energy is quadratic
in the fields, it does not obey a superposition principle. The energy of a compound
system is not the sum of the energies of its parts considered separately—there are
also “cross terms”:
Wtot =
=
ϵ0
2
E2 dτ =
ϵ0
2 (E1 + E2)2 dτ
ϵ0
2
E2
1 + E2
2 + 2E1· E2 dτ
= W1 + W2 + ϵ0 E1· E2 dτ. (2.47)
For example, if you double the charge everywhere, you quadruple the total energy.
Problem 2.36 Consider two concentric spherical shells, of radii a and b. Suppose
the inner one carries a charge q, and the outer one a charge−q (both of them
uniformly distributed over the surface). Calculate the energy of this configuration,
(a) using Eq. 2.45, and (b) using Eq. 2.47 and the results of Ex. 2.9.
Problem 2.37 Find the interaction energy (ϵ0 E1· E2 dτ in Eq. 2.47) for two point
charges, q1 and q2, a distance a apart. [Hint: Put q1 at the origin and q2 on the z axis;
use spherical coordinates, and do the r integral first.]
2.5 CONDUCTORS
2.5.1 Basic Properties
In an insulator, such as glass or rubber, each electron is on a short leash, attached
to a particular atom. In a metallic conductor, by contrast, one or more electrons
per atom are free to roam. (In liquid conductors such as salt water, it is ions that
do the moving.) A perfect conductor would contain an unlimited supply of free
charges. In real life there are no perfect conductors, but metals come pretty close,
for most purposes.
98 Chapter 2 Electrostatics
From this definition, the basic electrostatic properties of ideal conductors
immediately follow:
(i) E = 0 inside a conductor. Why? Because if there were any field, those
free charges would move, and it wouldn’t be electrostatics any more. Hmm...
that’s hardly a satisfactory explanation; maybe all it proves is that you can’t have
electrostatics when conductors are present. We had better examine what happens
when you put a conductor into an external electric field E0 (Fig. 2.42). Initially,
the field will drive any free positive charges to the right, and negative ones to the
left. (In practice, it’s the negative charges—electrons—that do the moving, but
when they depart, the right side is left with a net positive charge—the stationary
nuclei—so it doesn’t really matter which charges move; the effect is the same.)
When they come to the edge of the material, the charges pile up: plus on the right
side, minus on the left. Now, these induced charges produce a field of their own,
E1, which, as you can see from the figure, is in the opposite direction to E0. That’s
the crucial point, for it means that the field of the induced charges tends to cancel
the original field. Charge will continue to flow until this cancellation is complete,
and the resultant field inside the conductor is precisely zero.9 The whole process
is practically instantaneous.
(ii) ρ ρ ρ = 0 inside a conductor. This follows from Gauss’s law: ∇· E= ρ/ϵ0.
If E is zero, so also is ρ. There is still charge around, but exactly as much plus as
minus, so the net charge density in the interior is zero.
(iii) Any net charge resides on the surface. That’s the only place left.
(iv) A conductor is an equipotential. For if a and b are any two points
within (or at the surface of) a given conductor, V (b)− V (a)= −
b
E· dl= 0,
a
and hence V (a)= V (b).
(v) E is perpendicular to the surface, just outside a conductor. Otherwise,
as in (i), charge will immediately flow around the surface until it kills off the
tangential component (Fig. 2.43). (Perpendicular to the surface, charge cannot
flow, of course, since it is confined to the conducting object.)

FIGURE 2.43
I think it is astonishing that the charge on a conductor flows to the surface.
Because of their mutual repulsion, the charges naturally spread out as much as
possible, but for all of them to go to the surface seems like a waste of the interior
space. Surely we could do better, from the point of view of making each charge
as far as possible from its neighbors, to sprinkle some of them throughout the
volume... Well, it simply is not so. You do best to put all the charge on the
surface, and this is true regardless of the size or shape of the conductor.10
The problem can also be phrased in terms of energy. Like any other free
dynamical system, the charge on a conductor will seek the configuration that
minimizes its potential energy. What property (iii) asserts is that the electrostatic
energy of a solid object (with specified shape and total charge) is a minimum
when that charge is spread over the surface. For instance, the energy of a sphere
is (1/8πϵ0)(q2/R) if the charge is uniformly distributed over the surface, as we
found in Ex. 2.9, but it is greater, (3/20πϵ0)(q2/R), if the charge is uniformly
distributed throughout the volume (Prob. 2.34).
2.5.2 Induced Charges
If you hold a charge +q near an uncharged conductor (Fig. 2.44), the two will
attract one another. The reason for this is that q will pull minus charges over to
the near side and repel plus charges to the far side. (Another way to think of it
is that the charge moves around in such a way as to kill off the field of q for
points inside the conductor, where the total field must be zero.) Since the negative
induced charge is closer to q, there is a net force of attraction. (In Chapter 3 we
shall calculate this force explicitly, for the case of a spherical conductor.)
When I speak of the field, charge, or potential “inside” a conductor, I mean in
the “meat” of the conductor; if there is some hollow cavity in the conductor, and
10By the way, the one- and two-dimensional analogs are quite different: The charge on a conducting
disk does not all go to the perimeter (R. Friedberg, Am. J. Phys. 61, 1084 (1993)), nor does the charge
on a conducting needle go to the ends (D. J. Griffiths and Y. Li, Am. J. Phys. 64, 706 (1996))—see
Prob. 2.57. Moreover, if the exponent of r in Coulomb’s law were not precisely 2, the charge on a
solid conductor would not all go to the surface—see D. J. Griffiths and D. Z. Uvanovic, Am. J. Phys.
69, 435 (2001), and Prob. 2.54g.

within that cavity you put some charge, then the field in the cavity will not be zero.
But in a remarkable way the cavity and its contents are electrically isolated from
the outside world by the surrounding conductor (Fig. 2.45). No external fields
penetrate the conductor; they are canceled at the outer surface by the induced
charge there. Similarly, the field due to charges within the cavity is canceled,
for all exterior points, by the induced charge on the inner surface. However, the
compensating charge left over on the outer surface of the conductor effectively
“communicates” the presence of q to the outside world. The total charge induced
on the cavity wall is equal and opposite to the charge inside, for if we surround the
cavity with a Gaussian surface, all points of which are in the conductor (Fig. 2.45),
E· da = 0, and hence (by Gauss’s law) the net enclosed charge must be zero.
But Qenc = q + q induced , so q induced = −q. Then if the conductor as a whole is
electrically neutral, there must be a charge +q on its outer surface.
Example 2.10. An uncharged spherical conductor centered at the origin has a
cavity of some weird shape carved out of it (Fig. 2.46). Somewhere within the
cavity is a charge q. Question: What is the field outside the sphere?

At first glance, it would appear that the answer depends on the shape of the cavity

regardless. The conductor conceals from us all information concerning the na-
ture of the cavity, revealing only the total charge it contains. How can this be?
Well, the charge +q induces an opposite charge−q on the wall of the cavity,
which distributes itself in such a way that its field cancels that of q, for all points
exterior to the cavity. Since the conductor carries no net charge, this leaves +q to
distribute itself uniformly over the surface of the sphere. (It’s uniform because the
asymmetrical influence of the point charge +q is negated by that of the induced
charge−q on the inner surface.) For points outside the sphere, then, the only thing
that survives is the field of the leftover +q, uniformly distributed over the outer
surface.
It may occur to you that in one respect this argument is open to challenge:
There are actually three fields at work here: Eq , E induced, and E leftover. All we
know for certain is that the sum of the three is zero inside the conductor, yet I
claimed that the first two alone cancel, while the third is separately zero there.
Moreover, even if the first two cancel within the conductor, who is to say they still
cancel for points outside? They do not, after all, cancel for points inside the cavity.
I cannot give you a completely satisfactory answer at the moment, but this much
at least is true: There exists a way of distributing−q over the inner surface so as
to cancel the field of q at all exterior points. For that same cavity could have been
carved out of a huge spherical conductor with a radius of 27 miles or light years or
whatever. In that case, the leftover +q on the outer surface is simply too far away
to produce a significant field, and the other two fields would have to accomplish
the cancellation by themselves. So we know they can do it ... but are we sure
they choose to? Perhaps for small spheres nature prefers some complicated three-
way cancellation. Nope: As we’ll see in the uniqueness theorems of Chapter 3,
electrostatics is very stingy with its options; there is always precisely one way—
no more—of distributing the charge on a conductor so as to make the field inside
zero. Having found a possible way, we are guaranteed that no alternative exists,
even in principle.
If a cavity surrounded by conducting material is itself empty of charge, then the
field within the cavity is zero. For any field line would have to begin and end on the
cavity wall, going from a plus charge to a minus charge (Fig. 2.47). Letting that
field line be part of a closed loop, the rest of which is entirely inside the conductor
(where E= 0), the integral E· dl is distinctly positive, in violation of Eq. 2.19.
It follows that E= 0 within an empty cavity, and there is in fact no charge on the
surface of the cavity. (This is why you are relatively safe inside a metal car during
a thunderstorm—you may get cooked, if lightning strikes, but you will not be
electrocuted. The same principle applies to the placement of sensitive apparatus

Surface Charge and the Force on a Conductor
Because the field inside a conductor is zero, boundary condition 2.33 requires that
the field immediately outside is
σ
E=
ˆ
n, (2.48)
ϵ0
consistent with our earlier conclusion that the field is normal to the surface. In
terms of potential, Eq. 2.36 yields
∂V
σ = −ϵ0
∂n. (2.49)
These equations enable you to calculate the surface charge on a conductor, if you
can determine E or V ; we shall use them frequently in the next chapter.
In the presence of an electric field, a surface charge will experience a force;
the force per unit area, f, is σE. But there’s a problem here, for the electric field is
discontinuous at a surface charge, so what are we supposed to use: Eabove, Ebelow,
or something in between? The answer is that we should use the average of the two:
1
f= σE average =
2 σ(E above + E below). (2.50)

104 Chapter 2 Electrostatics
Why the average? The reason is very simple, though the telling makes it sound
complicated: Let’s focus our attention on a tiny patch of surface surrounding the
point in question (Fig. 2.50). (Make it small enough so it is essentially flat and
the surface charge on it is essentially constant.) The total field consists of two
parts—that attributable to the patch itself, and that due to everything else (other
regions of the surface, as well as any external sources that may be present):
E= E patch + E other.
Now, the patch cannot exert a force on itself, any more than you can lift yourself
by standing in a basket and pulling up on the handles. The force on the patch,
then, is due exclusively to E other, and this suffers no discontinuity (if we removed
the patch, the field in the “hole” would be perfectly smooth). The discontinuity is
due entirely to the charge on the patch, which puts out a field (σ/2ϵ0) on either
side, pointing away from the surface. Thus,
σ
E above = E other +
2ϵ0
σ
E below = E other−
ˆ
n,
ˆ
n,
2ϵ0
and hence
1
E other =
2 (E above + E below)= E average.
Averaging is really just a device for removing the contribution of the patch itself.
That argument applies to any surface charge; in the particular case of a con-
ductor, the field is zero inside and (σ/ϵ0)ˆ
n outside (Eq. 2.48), so the average is
(σ/2ϵ0)ˆ
n, and the force per unit area is
1
f=
σ2ˆ
n. (2.51)

This amounts to an outward electrostatic pressure on the surface, tending to draw
the conductor into the field, regardless of the sign of σ. Expressing the pressure

2.5.4 Capacitors
Suppose we have two conductors, and we put charge +Q on one and−Q on the
other (Fig. 2.51). Since V is constant over a conductor, we can speak unambigu-
ously of the potential difference between them:
V= V+− V−
= −
(−)
(+)
E· dl.
We don’t know how the charge distributes itself over the two conductors, and
calculating the field would be a nightmare, if their shapes are complicated, but
this much we do know: E is proportional to Q. For E is given by Coulomb’s law:
E=
1
4πϵ0
ρ
r2
ˆ
rdτ,
so if you double ρ, you double E. [Wait a minute! How do we know that dou-
bling Q (and also−Q) simply doubles ρ? Maybe the charge moves around into
a completely different configuration, quadrupling ρ in some places and halving it
in others, just so the total charge on each conductor is doubled. The fact is that
this concern is unwarranted—doubling Q does double ρ everywhere; it doesn’t
shift the charge around. The proof of this will come in Chapter 3; for now you’ll
just have to trust me.]
Since E is proportional to Q, so also is V . The constant of proportionality is
called the capacitance of the arrangement:
Q
C ≡
V. (2.53)
Capacitance is a purely geometrical quantity, determined by the sizes, shapes, and
separation of the two conductors. In SI units, C is measured in farads (F); a farad
is a coulomb-per-volt. Actually, this turns out to be inconveniently large; more
practical units are the microfarad (10−6 F) and the picofarad (10−12 F).
Notice that V is, by definition, the potential of the positive conductor less
that of the negative one; likewise, Q is the charge of the positive conductor. Ac-
cordingly, capacitance is an intrinsically positive quantity. (By the way, you will
occasionally hear someone speak of the capacitance of a single conductor. In this
case the “second conductor,” with the negative charge, is an imaginary spherical
shell of infinite radius surrounding the one conductor. It contributes nothing to
the field, so the capacitance is given by Eq. 2.53, where V is the potential with
infinity as the reference point.)

If we put +Q on the top and−Q on the bottom, they will spread out uniformly
over the two surfaces, provided the area is reasonably large and the separation
small.13 The surface charge density, then, is σ = Q/A on the top plate, and so the

To “charge up” a capacitor, you have to remove electrons from the positive
plate and carry them to the negative plate. In doing so, you fight against the electric
field, which is pulling them back toward the positive conductor and pushing them
away from the negative one. How much work does it take, then, to charge the
capacitor up to a final amount Q? Suppose that at some intermediate stage in the
process the charge on the positive plate is q, so that the potential difference is
q/C. According to Eq. 2.38, the work you must do to transport the next piece of
charge, dq, is

Use your result to estimate the gravitational energy of the sun (look up the relevant
numbers). Note that the energy is negative—masses attract, whereas (like) electric
charges repel. As the matter “falls in,” to create the sun, its energy is converted into
other forms (typically thermal), and it is subsequently released in the form of radia-
tion. The sun radiates at a rate of 3.86 × 1026 W; if all this came from gravitational
energy, how long would the sun last? [The sun is in fact much older than that, so
evidently this is not the source of its power.14]

3.1 LAPLACE’S EQUATION
3.1.1 Introduction
The primary task of electrostatics is to find the electric field of a given stationary
charge distribution. In principle, this purpose is accomplished by Coulomb’s law,
in the form of Eq. 2.8:
E(r)=
1
4πϵ0
ˆ
r
r2 ρ(r′)dτ′
. (3.1)
Unfortunately, integrals of this type can be difficult to calculate for any but the
simplest charge configurations. Occasionally we can get around this by exploiting
symmetry and using Gauss’s law, but ordinarily the best strategy is first to calcu-
late the potential, V , which is given by the somewhat more tractable Eq. 2.29:
V (r)=
1
4πϵ0
1
ρ(r′)dτ′
. (3.2)
r
Still, even this integral is often too tough to handle analytically. Moreover, in prob-
lems involving conductors ρ itself may not be known in advance; since charge is
free to move around, the only thing we control directly is the total charge (or
perhaps the potential) of each conductor.
In such cases, it is fruitful to recast the problem in differential form, using
Poisson’s equation (2.24),
1
∇2 V= −
ρ, (3.3)
ϵ0
which, together with appropriate boundary conditions, is equivalent to Eq. 3.2.
Very often, in fact, we are interested in finding the potential in a region where
ρ = 0. (If ρ = 0 everywhere, of course, then V= 0, and there is nothing further
to say—that’s not what I mean. There may be plenty of charge elsewhere, but
we’re confining our attention to places where there is no charge.) In this case,
Poisson’s equation reduces to Laplace’s equation:
∇2 V= 0, (3.4)

114 Chapter 3 Potentials
or, written out in Cartesian coordinates,
∂2 V
∂x2 +
∂2 V
∂y2 +
∂2 V
∂z2
= 0. (3.5)
This formula is so fundamental to the subject that one might almost say elec-
trostatics is the study of Laplace’s equation. At the same time, it is a ubiquitous
equation, appearing in such diverse branches of physics as gravitation and mag-
netism, the theory of heat, and the study of soap bubbles. In mathematics, it plays
a major role in analytic function theory. To get a feel for Laplace’s equation and
its solutions (which are called harmonic functions), we shall begin with the one-
and two-dimensional versions, which are easier to picture, and illustrate all the
essential properties of the three-dimensional case.
Laplace’s Equation in One Dimension
Suppose V depends on only one variable, x. Then Laplace’s equation becomes
d2 V
d x2
3.1.2 = 0.
The general solution is
V (x)= mx + b, (3.6)
the equation for a straight line. It contains two undetermined constants (m
and b), as is appropriate for a second-order (ordinary) differential equation. They
are fixed, in any particular case, by the boundary conditions of that problem. For
instance, it might be specified that V= 4 at x = 1, and V= 0 at x = 5. In that
case, m = −1 and b= 5, so V= −x + 5 (see Fig. 3.1).
I want to call your attention to two features of this result; they may seem silly
and obvious in one dimension, where I can write down the general solution explic-
itly, but the analogs in two and three dimensions are powerful and by no means
obvious:

3.1 Laplace’s Equation 115
1. V (x) is the average of V (x + a) and V (x− a), for any a:
1
V (x)=
2 [V (x + a) + V (x− a)].
Laplace’s equation is a kind of averaging instruction; it tells you to assign
to the point x the average of the values to the left and to the right of x.
Solutions to Laplace’s equation are, in this sense, as boring as they could
possibly be, and yet fit the end points properly.
2. Laplace’s equation tolerates no local maxima or minima; extreme values
of V must occur at the end points. Actually, this is a consequence of (1),
for if there were a local maximum, V would be greater at that point than
on either side, and therefore could not be the average. (Ordinarily, you
expect the second derivative to be negative at a maximum and positive at a
minimum. Since Laplace’s equation requires, on the contrary, that the sec-
ond derivative is zero, it seems reasonable that solutions should exhibit no
extrema. However, this is not a proof, since there exist functions that have
maxima and minima at points where the second derivative vanishes: x4, for
example, has such a minimum at the point x = 0.)
3.1.3 Laplace’s Equation in Two Dimensions
If V depends on two variables, Laplace’s equation becomes
∂2 V
∂x2 +
∂2 V
∂y2
= 0.
This is no longer an ordinary differential equation (that is, one involving ordinary
derivatives only); it is a partial differential equation. As a consequence, some of
the simple rules you may be familiar with do not apply. For instance, the gen-
eral solution to this equation doesn’t contain just two arbitrary constants—or, for
that matter, any finite number—despite the fact that it’s a second-order equation.
Indeed, one cannot write down a “general solution” (at least, not in a closed form
like Eq. 3.6). Nevertheless, it is possible to deduce certain properties common to
all solutions.
It may help to have a physical example in mind. Picture a thin rubber sheet (or a
soap film) stretched over some support. For definiteness, suppose you take a card-
board box, cut a wavy line all the way around, and remove the top part (Fig. 3.2).
Now glue a tightly stretched rubber membrane over the box, so that it fits like a
drum head (it won’t be a flat drumhead, of course, unless you chose to cut the
edges off straight). Now, if you lay out coordinates (x, y) on the bottom of the
box, the height V (x, y) of the sheet above the point (x, y) will satisfy Laplace’s

Harmonic functions in two dimensions have the same properties we noted in
one dimension:
1. The value of V at a point (x, y) is the average of those around the point.
More precisely, if you draw a circle of any radius R about the point (x, y),
the average value of V on the circle is equal to the value at the center:

circle
(This, incidentally, suggests the method of relaxation, on which computer
solutions to Laplace’s equation are based: Starting with specified values for
V at the boundary, and reasonable guesses for V on a grid of interior points,
the first pass reassigns to each point the average of its nearest neighbors.
The second pass repeats the process, using the corrected values, and so on.
After a few iterations, the numbers begin to settle down, so that subsequent
passes produce negligible changes, and a numerical solution to Laplace’s
equation, with the given boundary values, has been achieved.)2
2. V has no local maxima or minima; all extrema occur at the boundaries. (As
before, this follows from (1).) Again, Laplace’s equation picks the most
featureless function possible, consistent with the boundary conditions: no
hills, no valleys, just the smoothest conceivable surface. For instance, if
you put a ping-pong ball on the stretched rubber sheet of Fig. 3.2, it will

roll over to one side and fall off—it will not find a “pocket” somewhere to
settle into, for Laplace’s equation allows no such dents in the surface. From
a geometrical point of view, just as a straight line is the shortest distance
between two points, so a harmonic function in two dimensions minimizes
the surface area spanning the given boundary line.
Laplace’s Equation in Three Dimensions
In three dimensions I can neither provide you with an explicit solution (as in one
dimension) nor offer a suggestive physical example to guide your intuition (as I
did in two dimensions). Nevertheless, the same two properties remain true, and
this time I will sketch a proof.3
1. The value of V at point r is the average value of V over a spherical surface
of radius R centered at r:
V (r)=
1
4π R2
sphere
V da.
2. As a consequence, V can have no local maxima or minima; the extreme
values of V must occur at the boundaries. (For if V had a local maximum
at r, then by the very nature of maximum I could draw a sphere around r
over which all values of V —and a fortiori the average—would be less than
at r.)
Proof. Let’s begin by calculating the average potential over a spherical surface
of radius R due to a single point charge q located outside the sphere. We may as
well center the sphere at the origin and choose coordinates so that q lies on the
z-axis (Fig. 3.3). The potential at a point on the surface is

But this is precisely the potential due to q at the center of the sphere! By the
superposition principle, the same goes for any collection of charges outside the
sphere: their average potential over the sphere is equal to the net potential they
produce at the center.
Problem 3.1 Find the average potential over a spherical surface of radius R due to
a point charge q located inside (same as above, in other words, only with z < R).
(In this case, of course, Laplace’s equation does not hold within the sphere.) Show
that, in general,
Vave = Vcenter + Qenc

where Vcenter is the potential at the center due to all the external charges, and Qenc is
the total enclosed charge.
Problem 3.2 In one sentence, justify Earnshaw’s Theorem: A charged particle
cannot be held in a stable equilibrium by electrostatic forces alone. As an example,
consider the cubical arrangement of fixed charges in Fig. 3.4. It looks, off hand,
as though a positive charge at the center would be suspended in midair, since it
is repelled away from each corner. Where is the leak in this “electrostatic bottle”?
[To harness nuclear fusion as a practical energy source it is necessary to heat a
plasma (soup of charged particles) to fantastic temperatures—so hot that contact
would vaporize any ordinary pot. Earnshaw’s theorem says that electrostatic con-
tainment is also out of the question. Fortunately, it is possible to confine a hot plasma
magnetically.]

Boundary Conditions and Uniqueness Theorems
Laplace’s equation does not by itself determine V ; in addition, suitable boundary
conditions must be supplied. This raises a delicate question: What are appropriate
boundary conditions, sufficient to determine the answer and yet not so strong
as to generate inconsistencies? The one-dimensional case is easy, for here the
general solution V= mx + b contains two arbitrary constants, and we therefore
require two boundary conditions. We might, for instance, specify the value of the
function at each end, or we might give the value of the function and its derivative
at one end, or the value at one end and the derivative at the other, and so on.
But we cannot get away with just the value or just the derivative at one end—
this is insufficient information. Nor would it do to specify the derivatives at both
ends—this would either be redundant (if the two are equal) or inconsistent (if they
are not).
In two or three dimensions we are confronted by a partial differential equation,
and it is not so obvious what would constitute acceptable boundary conditions. Is
the shape of a taut rubber membrane, for instance, uniquely determined by the
frame over which it is stretched, or, like a canning jar lid, can it snap from one
stable configuration to another? The answer, as I think your intuition would sug-
gest, is that V is uniquely determined by its value at the boundary (canning jars
evidently do not obey Laplace’s equation). However, other boundary conditions
can also be used (see Prob. 3.5). The proof that a proposed set of boundary condi-
tions will suffice is usually presented in the form of a uniqueness theorem. There
are many such theorems for electrostatics, all sharing the same basic format—I’ll
show you the two most useful ones.4
First uniqueness theorem: The solution to Laplace’s equation in
some volume V is uniquely determined if V is specified on the
boundary surface S.
Proof. In Fig. 3.5 I have drawn such a region and its boundary. (There could also
be “islands” inside, so long as V is given on all their surfaces; also, the outer
4I do not intend to prove the existence of solutions here—that’s a much more difficult job. In context,
the existence is generally clear on physical grounds.

boundary could be at infinity, where V is ordinarily taken to be zero.) Suppose
there were two solutions to Laplace’s equation:
∇2 V1 = 0 and ∇2 V2 = 0,
both of which assume the specified value on the surface. I want to prove that they
must be equal. The trick is look at their difference:
V3 ≡ V1− V2.
This obeys Laplace’s equation,
∇2 V3 = ∇2 V1 − ∇2 V2 = 0,
and it takes the value zero on all boundaries (since V1 and V2 are equal there).
But Laplace’s equation allows no local maxima or minima—all extrema occur on
the boundaries. So the maximum and minimum of V3 are both zero. Therefore V3
must be zero everywhere, and hence
V1 = V2.
Example 3.1. Show that the potential is constant inside an enclosure com-
pletely surrounded by conducting material, provided there is no charge within the
enclosure.
Solution
The potential on the cavity wall is some constant, V0 (that’s item (iv), in
Sect. 2.5.1), so the potential inside is a function that satisfies Laplace’s equa-
tion and has the constant value V0 at the boundary. It doesn’t take a genius to
think of one solution to this problem: V= V0 everywhere. The uniqueness the-
orem guarantees that this is the only solution. (It follows that the field inside an
empty cavity is zero—the same result we found in Sect. 2.5.2 on rather different
grounds.)
The uniqueness theorem is a license to your imagination. It doesn’t matter
how you come by your solution; if (a) it satisfies Laplace’s equation and (b) it has
3.1 Laplace’s Equation 121
the correct value on the boundaries, then it’s right. You’ll see the power of this
argument when we come to the method of images.
Incidentally, it is easy to improve on the first uniqueness theorem: I assumed
there was no charge inside the region in question, so the potential obeyed
Laplace’s equation, but we may as well throw in some charge (in which case
V obeys Poisson’s equation). The argument is the same, only this time

Once again the difference (V3 ≡ V1− V2) satisfies Laplace’s equation and has the
value zero on all boundaries, so V3 = 0 and hence V1 = V2.
Corollary: The potential in a volume V is uniquely determined if
(a) the charge density throughout the region, and (b) the
value of V on all boundaries, are specified.
3.1.6 Conductors and the Second Uniqueness Theorem
The simplest way to set the boundary conditions for an electrostatic problem is to
specify the value of V on all surfaces surrounding the region of interest. And this
situation often occurs in practice: In the laboratory, we have conductors connected
to batteries, which maintain a given potential, or to ground, which is the exper-
imentalist’s word for V= 0. However, there are other circumstances in which
we do not know the potential at the boundary, but rather the charges on various
conducting surfaces. Suppose I put charge Qa on the first conductor, Qb on the
second, and so on—I’m not telling you how the charge distributes itself over each
conducting surface, because as soon as I put it on, it moves around in a way I do
not control. And for good measure, let’s say there is some specified charge density
ρ in the region between the conductors. Is the electric field now uniquely deter-
mined? Or are there perhaps a number of different ways the charges could arrange
themselves on their respective conductors, each leading to a different field?
Second uniqueness theorem: In a volume V surrounded by conduc-
tors and containing a specified charge density ρ, the electric field is
uniquely determined if the total charge on each conductor is given
(Fig. 3.6). (The region as a whole can be bounded by another con-
ductor, or else unbounded.)
Proof. Suppose there are two fields satisfying the conditions of the problem. Both
obey Gauss’s law in differential form in the space between the conductors:

Likewise, for the outer boundary (whether this is just inside an enclosing conduc-

which obeys
∇· E3 = 0 (3.7)
in the region between the conductors, and
E3· da = 0 (3.8)
over each boundary surface.
Now there is one final piece of information we must exploit: Although we
do not know how the charge Qi distributes itself over the i th conductor, we do
know that each conductor is an equipotential, and hence V3 is a constant (not
3.1 Laplace’s Equation 123
necessarily the same constant) over each conducting surface. (It need not be zero,
for the potentials V1 and V2 may not be equal—all we know for sure is that both
are constant over any given conductor.) Next comes a trick. Invoking product rule
number 5 (inside front cover), we find that
∇· (V3E3)= V3(∇· E3) + E3· (∇V3)= −(E3)2
.
Here I have used Eq. 3.7, and E3 = −∇V3. Integrating this over V, and applying
the divergence theorem to the left side:
∇· (V3E3)dτ =
V3E3· da = −
(E3)2 dτ.
V
S
V
The surface integral covers all boundaries of the region in question—the con-
ductors and outer boundary. Now V3 is a constant over each surface (if the outer
boundary is infinity, V3 = 0 there), so it comes outside each integral, and what
remains is zero, according to Eq. 3.8. Therefore,
(E3)2 dτ = 0.
V
But this integrand is never negative; the only way the integral can vanish is if
E3 = 0 everywhere. Consequently, E1 = E2, and the theorem is proved.
This proof was not easy, and there is a real danger that the theorem itself will
seem more plausible to you than the proof. In case you think the second unique-
ness theorem is “obvious,” consider this example of Purcell’s: Figure 3.7 shows
a simple electrostatic configuration, consisting of four conductors with charges
±Q, situated so that the plusses are near the minuses. It all looks very comfort-
able. Now, what happens if we join them in pairs, by tiny wires, as indicated in
Fig. 3.8? Since the positive charges are very near negative charges (which is where
they like to be) you might well guess that nothing will happen—the configuration
looks stable.
Well, that sounds reasonable, but it’s wrong. The configuration in Fig. 3.8 is
impossible. For there are now effectively two conductors, and the total charge
on each is zero. One possible way to distribute zero charge over these con-
ductors is to have no accumulation of charge anywhere, and hence zero field

everywhere (Fig. 3.9). By the second uniqueness theorem, this must be the solu-
tion: The charge will flow down the tiny wires, canceling itself off.
Problem 3.5 Prove that the field is uniquely determined when the charge density ρ
is given and either V or the normal derivative ∂V /∂n is specified on each boundary
surface. Do not assume the boundaries are conductors, or that V is constant over
any given surface.
Problem 3.6 A more elegant proof of the second uniqueness theorem uses Green’s
identity (Prob. 1.61c), with T= U= V3. Supply the details.
3.2 THE METHOD OF IMAGES
3.2.1 The Classic Image Problem
Suppose a point charge q is held a distance d above an infinite grounded con-
ducting plane (Fig. 3.10). Question: What is the potential in the region above the
plane? It’s not just (1/4πϵ0)q/r, for q will induce a certain amount of negative
charge on the nearby surface of the conductor; the total potential is due in part
to q directly, and in part to this induced charge. But how can we possibly calcu-
late the potential, when we don’t know how much charge is induced or how it is
distributed?
From a mathematical point of view, our problem is to solve Poisson’s equa-
tion in the region z > 0, with a single point charge q at (0,0,d), subject to the
boundary conditions:
1. V= 0 when z = 0 (since the conducting plane is grounded), and
2. V → 0 far from the charge that is, for x2 + y2 + z2 ≫ d2
.
The first uniqueness theorem (actually, its corollary) guarantees that there is only
one function that meets these requirements. If by trick or clever guess we can
discover such a function, it’s got to be the answer.
Trick: Forget about the actual problem; we’re going to study a completely
different situation. This new configuration consists of two point charges, +q at

figuration, I can easily write down the potential:

q
−
x2 + y2 + (z + d)2. (3.9)
q
(The denominators represent the distances from (x, y, z) to the charges +q and
−q, respectively.) It follows that
1. V= 0 when z = 0,
2. V → 0 for x2 + y2 + z2 ≫ d2
,
and the only charge in the region z > 0 is the point charge +q at (0,0,d). But
these are precisely the conditions of the original problem! Evidently the second
configuration happens to produce exactly the same potential as the first config-
uration, in the “upper” region z ≥ 0. (The “lower” region, z < 0, is completely
different, but who cares? The upper part is all we need.) Conclusion: The poten-
tial of a point charge above an infinite grounded conductor is given by Eq. 3.9, for
z ≥ 0.
Notice the crucial role played by the uniqueness theorem in this argument:
without it, no one would believe this solution, since it was obtained for a com-
pletely different charge distribution. But the uniqueness theorem certifies it: If it
satisfies Poisson’s equation in the region of interest, and assumes the correct value
at the boundaries, then it must be right.
3.2.2 Induced Surface Charge
Now that we know the potential, it is a straightforward matter to compute the
surface charge σ induced on the conductor. According to Eq. 2.49,
σ = −ϵ0
∂V
∂n
,
126 Chapter 3 Potentials
where ∂V /∂n is the normal derivative of V at the surface. In this case the normal
direction is the z direction, so

σ(x, y)=
−qd
2π(x2 + y2 + d2)3/2. (3.10)
As expected, the induced charge is negative (assuming q is positive) and greatest
at x = y= 0.
While we’re at it, let’s compute the total induced charge
Q= σ da.
This integral, over the x y plane, could be done in Cartesian coordinates, with
da= d x d y, but it’s a little easier to use polar coordinates (r,φ), with r 2
= x2 +y2
and da= r dr dφ. Then

The total charge induced on the plane is−q, as (with benefit of hindsight) you
can perhaps convince yourself it had to be.
3.2.3 Force and Energy
The charge q is attracted toward the plane, because of the negative induced charge.
Let’s calculate the force of attraction. Since the potential in the vicinity of q is the
same as in the analog problem (the one with +q and−q but no conductor), so
also is the field and, therefore, the force:

3.2 The Method of Images 127
Beware: It is easy to get carried away, and assume that everything is the same
in the two problems. Energy, however, is not the same. With the two point charges

But for a single charge and conducting plane, the energy is half of this:

Why half? Think of the energy stored in the fields (Eq. 2.45):

E2 dτ.
In the first case, both the upper region (z > 0) and the lower region (z < 0)
contribute—and by symmetry they contribute equally. But in the second case,
only the upper region contains a nonzero field, and hence the energy is half as
great.6
Of course, one could also determine the energy by calculating the work
required to bring q in from infinity. The force required (to oppose the electri-
cal force in Eq. 3.12) is (1/4πϵ0)(q2/4z2)ˆ

As I move q toward the conductor, I do work only on q. It is true that induced
charge is moving in over the conductor, but this costs me nothing, since the whole
conductor is at potential zero. By contrast, if I simultaneously bring in two point
charges (with no conductor), I do work on both of them, and the total is (again)
twice as great.
3.2.4 Other Image Problems
The method just described is not limited to a single point charge; any station-
ary charge distribution near a grounded conducting plane can be treated in the
same way, by introducing its mirror image—hence the name method of images.
(Remember that the image charges have the opposite sign; this is what guarantees
that the x y plane will be at potential zero.) There are also some exotic problems
that can be handled in similar fashion; the nicest of these is the following.

points with a fixed ratio of distances from two given points is a sphere. See J. C. Maxwell, “Treatise on

Problem 3.12 Two long, straight copper pipes, each of radius R, are held a distance
2d apart. One is at potential V0, the other at−V0 (Fig. 3.16). Find the potential
everywhere. [Hint: Exploit the result of Prob. 2.52.]
3.3 SEPARATION OF VARIABLES
In this section we shall attack Laplace’s equation directly, using the method of
separation of variables, which is the physicist’s favorite tool for solving par-
tial differential equations. The method is applicable in circumstances where the
potential (V ) or the charge density (σ) is specified on the boundaries of some
region, and we are asked to find the potential in the interior. The basic strategy is
very simple: We look for solutions that are products of functions, each of which
depends on only one of the coordinates. The algebraic details, however, can be
formidable, so I’m going to develop the method through a sequence of examples.
We’ll start with Cartesian coordinates and then do spherical coordinates (I’ll leave
the cylindrical case for you to tackle on your own, in Prob. 3.24).
3.3 Separation of Variables 131
3.3.1 Cartesian Coordinates
Example 3.3. Two infinite grounded metal plates lie parallel to the x z plane,
one at y= 0, the other at y= a (Fig. 3.17). The left end, at x = 0, is closed off
with an infinite strip insulated from the two plates, and maintained at a specific
potential V0(y). Find the potential inside this “slot.”

The configuration is independent of z, so this is really a two-dimensional problem.
In mathematical terms, we must solve Laplace’s equation,

subject to the boundary conditions
(i) V= 0 when y= 0,
(ii) V= 0 when y= a,
(iii) V= V0(y) when x = 0,
(iv) V → 0 as x → ∞.
⎫ ⎪ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎪ ⎭
(3.21)
(The latter, although not explicitly stated in the problem, is necessary on physical
grounds: as you get farther and farther away from the “hot” strip at x = 0, the
potential should drop to zero.) Since the potential is specified on all boundaries,
the answer is uniquely determined.
The first step is to look for solutions in the form of products:
V (x, y)= X (x)Y (y). (3.22)
On the face of it, this is an absurd restriction—the overwhelming majority of
solutions to Laplace’s equation do not have such a form. For example, V (x, y)=
132 Chapter 3 Potentials
(5x + 6y) satisfies Eq. 3.20, but you can’t express it as the product of a function x
times a function y. Obviously, we’re only going to get a tiny subset of all possible
solutions by this means, and it would be a miracle if one of them happened to fit
the boundary conditions of our problem... But hang on, because the solutions
we do get are very special, and it turns out that by pasting them together we can
construct the general solution.
Anyway, putting Eq. 3.22 into Eq. 3.20, we obtain
Y
d2 X
d x2 + X
d2Y
d y2
= 0.
The next step is to “separate the variables” (that is, collect all the x-dependence
into one term and all the y-dependence into another). Typically, this is accom-
plished by dividing through by V :
1
X
d2 X
d x2 +
= 0. (3.23)
Y
Here the first term depends only on x and the second only on y; in other words,
we have an equation of the form
1
d2Y
d y2
f (x) + g(y)= 0. (3.24)
Now, there’s only one way this could possibly be true: f and g must both be
constant. For what if f (x) changed, as you vary x—then if we held y fixed and
fiddled with x, the sum f (x) + g(y) would change, in violation of Eq. 3.24, which
says it’s always zero. (That’s a simple but somehow rather elusive argument; don’t
accept it without due thought, because the whole method rides on it.)
It follows from Eq. 3.23, then, that
1
X
d2 X
d x2
= C1 and
1
Y
d2Y
d y2
= C2, with C1 + C2 = 0. (3.25)
One of these constants is positive, the other negative (or perhaps both are zero).
In general, one must investigate all the possibilities; however, in our particular
problem we need C1 positive and C2 negative, for reasons that will appear in a
moment. Thus
d2 X
d2Y
= k2 X,
= −k2Y. (3.26)
d x2
d y2
Notice what has happened: A partial differential equation (3.20) has been con-
verted into two ordinary differential equations (3.26). The advantage of this is
obvious—ordinary differential equations are a lot easier to solve. Indeed:
X (x)= Aekx + Be−kx
, Y (y)= C sin ky + D cos ky,
so
V (x, y)= (Aekx + Be−kx )(C sin ky + D cos ky). (3.27)
3.3 Separation of Variables 133
This is the appropriate separable solution to Laplace’s equation; it remains to
impose the boundary conditions, and see what they tell us about the constants. To
begin at the end, condition (iv) requires that A equal zero.8 Absorbing B into C
and D, we are left with
V (x, y)= e−kx (C sin ky + D cos ky).
Condition (i) now demands that D equal zero, so
V (x, y)= Ce−kx sin ky. (3.28)
Meanwhile (ii) yields sin ka= 0, from which it follows that
nπ
k=
, (n = 1,2,3,...). (3.29)
a
(At this point you can see why I chose C1 positive and C2 negative: If X were
sinusoidal, we could never arrange for it to go to zero at infinity, and if Y were
exponential we could not make it vanish at both 0 and a. Incidentally, n = 0 is
no good, for in that case the potential vanishes everywhere. And we have already
excluded negative n’s.)
That’s as far as we can go, using separable solutions, and unless V0(y) just
happens to have the form sin(nπy/a) for some integer n, we simply can’t fit the
final boundary condition at x = 0. But now comes the crucial step that redeems
the method: Separation of variables has given us an infinite family of solutions
(one for each n), and whereas none of them by itself satisfies the final boundary
condition, it is possible to combine them in a way that does. Laplace’s equation is
linear, in the sense that if V1, V2, V3, ... satisfy it, so does any linear combina-
tion, V= α1 V1 + α2 V2 + α3 V3 +... , where α1, α2,... are arbitrary constants.
For
∇2 V= α1∇2 V1 + α2∇2 V2 +...
= 0α1 + 0α2 +...
= 0.
Exploiting this fact, we can patch together the separable solutions (Eq. 3.28) to
construct a much more general solution:
V (x, y)=
∞
n=1
Cn e−nπx/a sin(nπy/a). (3.30)
This still satisfies three of the boundary conditions; the question is, can we (by
astute choice of the coefficients Cn ) fit the final boundary condition (iii)?
V (0, y)=
∞
n=1
Cn sin(nπy/a)= V0(y). (3.31)
8I’m assuming k is positive, but this involves no loss of generality—negative k gives the same solution
(Eq. 3.27), only with the constants shuffled ( A ↔ B,C → −C). Occasionally (though not in this
example) k= 0 must also be included (see Prob. 3.54).
134 Chapter 3 Potentials
Well, you may recognize this sum—it’s a Fourier sine series. And Dirichlet’s
theorem9 guarantees that virtually any function V0(y)—it can even have a finite
number of discontinuities—can be expanded in such a series.
But how do we actually determine the coefficients Cn , buried as they are in that
infinite sum? The device for accomplishing this is so lovely it deserves a name—I
call it Fourier’s trick, though it seems Euler had used essentially the same idea
somewhat earlier. Here’s how it goes: Multiply Eq. 3.31 by sin(n′πy/a) (where
n′ is a positive integer), and integrate from 0 to a:
∞
n=1
Cn

a
sin(nπy/a) sin(n′πy/a)d y=

V0(y)sin(n′πy/a)d y. (3.32)

You can work out the integral on the left for yourself; the answer is
a
sin(nπy/a) sin(n′πy/a)d y=
0
⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩

2, if n′
= n.
(3.33)
Thus all the terms in the series drop out, save only the one where n = n′, and the
left side of Eq. 3.32, reduces to (a/2)Cn′ . Conclusion:10

That does it: Eq. 3.30 is the solution, with coefficients given by Eq. 3.34.

stant potential V0 (remember, it’s insulated from the grounded plates at y= 0 and
y= a). Then

In this form, it is easy to check that Laplace’s equation is obeyed and the four
boundary conditions (Eq. 3.21) are satisfied.
The success of this method hinged on two extraordinary properties of the sep-
arable solutions (Eqs. 3.28 and 3.29): completeness and orthogonality. A set of
functions fn (y) is said to be complete if any other function f (y) can be expressed
as a linear combination of them:
f (y)=
∞
n=1
Cn fn (y). (3.38)
The functions sin(nπy/a) are complete on the interval 0 ≤ y ≤ a. It was this fact,
guaranteed by Dirichlet’s theorem, that assured us Eq. 3.31 could be satisfied,
given the proper choice of the coefficients Cn . (The proof of completeness, for
a particular set of functions, is an extremely difficult business, and I’m afraid
136 Chapter 3 Potentials
physicists tend to assume it’s true and leave the checking to others.) A set of
functions is orthogonal if the integral of the product of any two different members
of the set is zero:
a
fn (y) fn′ (y)d y= 0 for n′ ̸= n. (3.39)
0
The sine functions are orthogonal (Eq. 3.33); this is the property on which
Fourier’s trick is based, allowing us to kill off all terms but one in the infinite
series and thereby solve for the coefficients Cn . (Proof of orthogonality is gen-
erally quite simple, either by direct integration or by analysis of the differential
equation from which the functions came.)
Example 3.4. Two infinitely-long grounded metal plates, again at y= 0 and
y= a, are connected at x = ±b by metal strips maintained at a constant potential
V0, as shown in Fig. 3.20 (a thin layer of insulation at each corner prevents them
from shorting out). Find the potential inside the resulting rectangular pipe.

This time, however, we cannot set A= 0; the region in question does not
extend to x = ∞, so ekx is perfectly acceptable. On the other hand, the situa-
tion is symmetric with respect to x, so V (−x, y)= V (x, y), and it follows that
A= B. Using
ekx + e−kx
= 2 cosh kx,
and absorbing 2 A into C and D, we have
V (x, y)= cosh kx (C sin ky + D cos ky).
Boundary conditions (i) and (ii) require, as before, that D= 0 and k= nπ/a, so
V (x, y)= C cosh(nπx/a) sin(nπy/a). (3.41)
Because V (x, y) is even in x, it will automatically meet condition (iv) if it fits
(iii). It remains, therefore, to construct the general linear combination,

Notice that Pl (x) is (as the name suggests) an lth-order polynomial in x; it con-
tains only even powers, if l is even, and odd powers, if l is odd. The factor in front
(1/2l l!) was chosen in order that
Pl (1)= 1. (3.63)
The Rodrigues formula obviously works only for nonnegative integer values
of l. Moreover, it provides us with only one solution. But Eq. 3.60 is second-
order, and it should possess two independent solutions, for every value of l. It
turns out that these “other solutions” blow up at θ= 0 and/or θ= π, and are
therefore unacceptable on physical grounds.13 For instance, the second solution
for l= 0 is
(θ)= ln tan
θ
2. (3.64)
You might want to check for yourself that this satisfies Eq. 3.60.
In the case of azimuthal symmetry, then, the most general separable solution
to Laplace’s equation, consistent with minimal physical requirements, is
V (r,θ)= Arl +
B
rl+1 Pl (cos θ).
(There was no need to include an overall constant in Eq. 3.61 because it can be
absorbed into A and B at this stage.) As before, separation of variables yields an
infinite set of solutions, one for each l. The general solution is the linear combi-
nation of separable solutions:

Example 3.6. The potential V0(θ) is specified on the surface of a hollow sphere,
of radius R. Find the potential inside the sphere.

In this case, Bl = 0 for all l—otherwise the potential would blow up at the origin.
Thus,

13In rare cases where the z axis is excluded, these “other solutions” do have to be considered.

At r = R this must match the specified function V0(θ):
Al Rl Pl (cos θ)= V0(θ). V (R,θ)=

(3.67)
Can this equation be satisfied, for an appropriate choice of coefficients Al ? Yes:
The Legendre polynomials (like the sines) constitute a complete set of functions,
on the interval−1 ≤ x ≤ 1 (0 ≤ θ ≤ π). How do we determine the constants?
Again, by Fourier’s trick, for the Legendre polynomials (like the sines) are or-
thogonal functions:14

(3.69)
Equation 3.66 is the solution to our problem, with the coefficients given by
Eq. 3.69.
It can be difficult to evaluate integrals of the form 3.69 analytically, and in
practice it is often easier to solve Eq. 3.67 “by eyeball.”15 For instance, suppose
we are told that the potential on the sphere is
V0(θ)= k sin2(θ/2), (3.70)
where k is a constant. Using the half-angle formula, we rewrite this as
k
k
V0(θ)=
2 (1− cos θ)=
2 [P0(cos θ)− P1(cos θ)].
14M. Boas, Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences, 2nd ed. (New York: John Wiley, 1983),
Section 12.7.
15This is certainly true whenever V0(θ) can be expressed as a polynomial in cos θ. The degree of the
polynomial tells us the highest l we require, and the leading coefficient determines the corresponding
Al . Subtracting off Al Rl Pl (cos θ) and repeating the process, we systematically work our way down
to A0. Notice that if V0 is an even function of cos θ, then only even terms will occur in the sum (and
likewise for odd functions).
3.3 Separation of Variables 145
Putting this into Eq. 3.67, we read off immediately that A0 = k/2, A1 = −k/(2R),
and all other Al ’s vanish. Therefore,

Example 3.7. The potential V0(θ) is again specified on the surface of a sphere of
radius R, but this time we are asked to find the potential outside, assuming there
is no charge there.

problem.
Example 3.8. An uncharged metal sphere of radius R is placed in an other-
wise uniform electric field E= E0ˆ
z. The field will push positive charge to the
“northern” surface of the sphere, and—symmetrically—negative charge to the
“southern” surface (Fig. 3.24). This induced charge, in turn, distorts the field in
the neighborhood of the sphere. Find the potential in the region outside the sphere.
146 Chapter 3 Potentials
Solution
The sphere is an equipotential—we may as well set it to zero. Then by symmetry
the entire x y plane is at potential zero. This time, however, V does not go to zero
at large z. In fact, far from the sphere the field is E0ˆ
z, and hence
V → −E0 z + C.

Since V= 0 in the equatorial plane, the constant C must be zero. Accordingly,
the boundary conditions for this problem are
(i) V= 0 when r = R,
(ii) V → −E0r cos θ for r ≫ R.

We must fit these boundary conditions with a function of the form 3.65.

Evidently only one term is present: l= 1. In fact, since P1(cos θ)= cos θ, we can
read off immediately

It follows that the coefficients of like Legendre polynomials are equal:

(To prove that formally, multiply both sides of Eq. 3.80 by Pl′ (cos θ)sin θ and
integrate from 0 to π, using the orthogonality relation 3.68.) Second, the radial

Equations 3.78 and 3.79 constitute the solution to our problem, with the coeffi-
cients given by Eqs. 3.81 and 3.84.
For instance, if
σ0(θ)= k cos θ= k P1(cos θ), (3.85)
for some constant k, then all the Al ’s are zero except for l= 1, and
A1 =

The potential inside the sphere is therefore

whereas outside the sphere

In particular, if σ0(θ) is the induced charge on a metal sphere in an external

z, so that k= 3ϵ0 E0 (Eq. 3.77), then the potential inside is E0r cos θ=
E0 z, and the field is−E0ˆ

course it should be. Outside the sphere the potential due to this surface charge is

Approximate Potentials at Large Distances
If you are very far away from a localized charge distribution, it “looks” like a point
charge, and the potential is—to good approximation—(1/4πϵ0)Q/r , where Q is
the total charge. We have often used this as a check on formulas for V . But what
if Q is zero? You might reply that the potential is then approximately zero, and of
course, you’re right, in a sense (indeed, the potential at large r is pretty small even
if Q is not zero). But we’re looking for something a bit more informative than that.

The potential of a dipole goes like 1/r 2 at large r ; as we might have anticipated,
it falls off more rapidly than the potential of a point charge. If we put together
a pair of equal and opposite dipoles to make a quadrupole, the potential goes
like 1/r 3; for back-to-back quadrupoles (an octopole), it goes like 1/r 4; and so
on. Figure 3.27 summarizes this hierarchy; for completeness I have included the
electric monopole (point charge), whose potential, of course, goes like 1/r .

154 Chapter 3 Potentials
This is the desired result—the multipole expansion of V in powers of 1/r .
The first term (n = 0) is the monopole contribution (it goes like 1/r ); the sec-
ond (n = 1) is the dipole (it goes like 1/r 2); the third is quadrupole; the fourth
octopole; and so on. Remember that α is the angle between r and r′, so the inte-
grals depend on the direction to the field point. If you are interested in the poten-
tial along the z′ axis (or—putting it the other way around—if you orient your r′
coordinates so the z′ axis lies along r), then α is the usual polar angle θ′
.
As it stands, Eq. 3.95 is exact, but it is useful primarily as an approxima-
tion scheme: the lowest nonzero term in the expansion provides the approximate
potential at large r , and the successive terms tell us how to improve the approxi-
mation if greater precision is required.

3.4.2 The Monopole and Dipole Terms
Ordinarily, the multipole expansion is dominated (at large r ) by the monopole
term:
1
Q
Vmon(r)=
, (3.97)
4πϵ0
r
where Q= ρ dτ is the total charge of the configuration. This is just what we
expect for the approximate potential at large distances from the charge. For a point
charge at the origin, Vmon is the exact potential, not merely a first approximation
at large r ; in this case, all the higher multipoles vanish.
If the total charge is zero, the dominant term in the potential will be the dipole
(unless, of course, it also vanishes):
Vdip(r)=
1
4πϵ0
1
r 2 r ′ cos α ρ(r′)dτ′
.
Since α is the angle between r′ and r (Fig. 3.28),
r ′ cos α =
ˆ
r· r′
,
and the dipole potential can be written more succinctly:
1
1
Vdip(r)=
ˆ
r· r′ρ(r′)dτ′

4πϵ0

3.4 Multipole Expansion 155
This integral (which does not depend on r) is called the dipole moment of the
distribution:

and the dipole contribution to the potential simplifies to

Vdip(r)=

The dipole moment is determined by the geometry (size, shape, and density)

for point, line, and surface charges. Thus, the dipole moment of a collection of

−)= qd, (3.101)
where d is the vector from the negative charge to the positive one (Fig. 3.29).
Is this consistent with what we got in Ex. 3.10? Yes: If you put Eq. 3.101 into
Eq. 3.99, you recover Eq. 3.90. Notice, however, that this is only the approximate
potential of the physical dipole—evidently there are higher multipole contribu-
tions. Of course, as you go farther and farther away, Vdip becomes a better and
better approximation, since the higher terms die off more rapidly with increas-
ing r . By the same token, at a fixed r the dipole approximation improves as you
shrink the separation d. To construct a perfect (point) dipole whose potential is
given exactly by Eq. 3.99, you’d have to let d approach zero. Unfortunately, you
then lose the dipole term too, unless you simultaneously arrange for q to go to in-
finity! A physical dipole becomes a pure dipole, then, in the rather artificial limit
d → 0, q → ∞, with the product qd= p held fixed. When someone uses the
word “dipole,” you can’t always tell whether they mean a physical dipole (with

sume that d is small enough (compared to r ) that you can safely apply Eq. 3.99.
Dipole moments are vectors, and they add accordingly: if you have two
dipoles, p1 and p2, the total dipole moment is p1 + p2. For instance, with four
charges at the corners of a square, as shown in Fig. 3.30, the net dipole moment is
zero. You can see this by combining the charges in pairs (vertically, ↓ + ↑= 0,
or horizontally, → + ← = 0) or by adding up the four contributions individually,
using Eq. 3.100. This is a quadrupole, as I indicated earlier, and its potential is
dominated by the quadrupole term in the multipole expansion.

3.4.3 3.4 Multipole Expansion 157
Origin of Coordinates in Multipole Expansions
I mentioned earlier that a point charge at the origin constitutes a “pure” monopole.
If it is not at the origin, it’s no longer a pure monopole. For instance, the charge
in Fig. 3.32 has a dipole moment p= qdˆ
y, and a corresponding dipole term in
its potential. The monopole potential (1/4πϵ0)q/r is not quite correct for this
configuration; rather, the exact potential is (1/4πϵ0)q/r. The multipole expansion
is, remember, a series in inverse powers of r (the distance to the origin), and when
we expand 1/r, we get all powers, not just the first.
So moving the origin (or, what amounts to the same thing, moving the charge)
can radically alter a multipole expansion. The monopole moment Q does not
change, since the total charge is obviously independent of the coordinate system.
(In Fig. 3.32, the monopole term was unaffected when we moved q away from
the origin—it’s just that it was no longer the whole story: a dipole term—and for
that matter all higher poles—appeared as well.) Ordinarily, the dipole moment
does change when you shift the origin, but there is an important exception: If the
total charge is zero, then the dipole moment is independent of the choice of origin.
For suppose we displace the origin by an amount a (Fig. 3.33). The new dipole
moment is then

3.4.4 The Electric Field of a Dipole
So far we have worked only with potentials. Now I would like to calculate the
electric field of a (perfect) dipole. If we choose coordinates so that p is at the origin
and points in the z direction (Fig. 3.36), then the potential at r,θ is (Eq. 3.99):
Vdip(r,θ)=
ˆ
r· p
4πϵ0r 2
=
p cos θ
4πϵ0r 2. (3.102)
To get the field, we take the negative gradient of V :
Er = −

Eθ = −

Thus
Edip(r,θ)=

r + sin θˆ
θ ). (3.103)

This formula makes explicit reference to a particular coordinate system (spher-
ical) and assumes a particular orientation for p (along z). It can be recast in a
coordinate-free form, analogous to the potential in Eq. 3.99—see Prob. 3.36.
Notice that the dipole field falls off as the inverse cube of r ; the monopole field
(Q/4πϵ0r 2)ˆ
r goes as the inverse square, of course. Quadrupole fields go like
1/r 4, octopole like 1/r 5, and so on. (This merely reflects the fact that monopole
potentials fall off like 1/r , dipole like 1/r 2, quadrupole like 1/r 3, and so on—the
gradient introduces another factor of 1/r .)
Figure 3.37(a) shows the field lines of a “pure” dipole (Eq. 3.103). For com-
parison, I have also sketched the field lines for a “physical” dipole, in Fig. 3.37(b).
Notice how similar the two pictures become if you blot out the central region; up
close, however, they are entirely different. Only for points r ≫ d does Eq. 3.103
represent a valid approximation to the field of a physical dipole. As I mentioned
earlier, this régime can be reached either by going to large r or by squeezing the
charges very close together.17

17Even in the limit, there remains an infinitesimal region at the origin where the field of a physical
dipole points in the “wrong” direction, as you can see by “walking” down the z axis in Fig. 3.35(b). If
you want to explore this subtle and important point, work Prob. 3.48.

Problem 3.37 In Section 3.1.4, I proved that the electrostatic potential at any point
P in a charge-free region is equal to its average value over any spherical surface
(radius R) centered at P. Here’s an alternative argument that does not rely on
Coulomb’s law, only on Laplace’s equation. We might as well set the origin at P.
Let Vave(R) be the average; first show that
d Vave
d R=
1
4π R2 ∇V· da
(note that the R2 in da cancels the 1/R2 out front, so the only dependence on R
is in V itself). Now use the divergence theorem, and conclude that if V satisfies
Laplace’s equation, then Vave(R)= Vave(0)= V (P), for all R.

Problem 3.38 Here’s an alternative derivation of Eq. 3.10 (the surface charge den-
sity induced on a grounded conducted plane by a point charge q a distance d above
the plane). This approach19 (which generalizes to many other problems) does not
rely on the method of images. The total field is due in part to q, and in part to the
induced surface charge. Write down the z components of these fields—in terms of
q and the as-yet-unknown σ(x, y)—just below the surface. The sum must be zero,
of course, because this is inside a conductor. Use that to determine σ.

Problem 3.41 Buckminsterfullerine is a molecule of 60 carbon atoms arranged

ical shell of radius R= 3.5 Å. A nearby electron would be attracted, according to
Prob. 3.9, so it is not surprising that the ion C−
60 exists. (Imagine that the electron—
on average—smears itself out uniformly over the surface.) But how about a second
electron? At large distances it would be repelled by the ion, obviously, but at a cer-
tain distance r (from the center), the net force is zero, and closer than this it would
be attracted. So an electron with enough energy to get in that close should bind.

162 Chapter 3 Potentials
Problem 3.42 You can use the superposition principle to combine solutions
obtained by separation of variables. For example, in Prob. 3.16 you found the
potential inside a cubical box, if five faces are grounded and the sixth is at a con-
stant potential V0; by a six-fold superposition of the result, you could obtain the
potential inside a cube with the faces maintained at specified constant voltages V1,
V2, . . . V6. In this way, using Ex. 3.4 and Prob. 3.15, find the potential inside a
rectangular pipe with two facing sides (x = ±b) at potential V0, a third (y= a) at
V1, and the last (at y= 0) grounded.

in terms of the dipole moment of q.
(c) Use the superposition principle to generalize to an arbitrary charge distribution.
(d) While you’re at it, show that the average field over the volume of a sphere, due
to all the charges outside, is the same as the field they produce at the center.
Problem 3.48
(a) Using Eq. 3.103, calculate the average electric field of a dipole, over a spher-
ical volume of radius R, centered at the origin. Do the angular integrals first.
[Note: You must expressˆ
r andˆ
θ in terms ofˆ
ˆ
x,
y, andˆ
z (see back cover) before
integrating. If you don’t understand why, reread the discussion in Sect. 1.4.1.]
Compare your answer with the general theorem (Eq. 3.105). The discrepancy
here is related to the fact that the field of a dipole blows up at r = 0. The angular
integral is zero, but the radial integral is infinite, so we really don’t know what
to make of the answer. To resolve this dilemma, let’s say that Eq. 3.103 applies
outside a tiny sphere of radius ϵ—its contribution to Eave is then unambiguously
zero, and the whole answer has to come from the field inside the ϵ-sphere.
(b) What must the field inside the ϵ-sphere be, in order for the general theorem
(Eq. 3.105) to hold? [Hint: since ϵ is arbitrarily small, we’re talking about some-
thing that is infinite at r = 0 and whose integral over an infinitesimal volume is
finite.] [Answer:−(p/3ϵ0)δ3(r)]
Evidently, the true field of a dipole is

Edip(r)=

You may wonder how we missed the delta-function term23 when we calculated
the field back in Sect. 3.4.4. The answer is that the differentiation leading to
Eq. 3.103 is valid except at r = 0, but we should have known (from our experience
in Sect. 1.5.1) that the point r = 0 would be problematic.24
Problem 3.49 In Ex. 3.9, we obtained the potential of a spherical shell with surface
charge σ(θ)= k cos θ. In Prob. 3.30, you found that the field is pure dipole out-
side; it’s uniform inside (Eq. 3.86). Show that the limit R → 0 reproduces the delta
function term in Eq. 3.106.
Problem 3.50
(a) Suppose a charge distribution ρ1(r) produces a potential V1(r), and some other
charge distribution ρ2(r) produces a potential V2(r). [The two situations may
have nothing in common, for all I care—perhaps number 1 is a uniformly
charged sphere and number 2 is a parallel-plate capacitor. Please understand
that ρ1 and ρ2 are not present at the same time; we are talking about two differ-
ent problems, one in which only ρ1 is present, and another in which only ρ2 is
present.] Prove Green’s reciprocity theorem:25

[Hint: Evaluate E1· E2 dτ two ways, first writing E1 = −∇V1 and using in-
tegration by parts to transfer the derivative to E2, then writing E2 = −∇V2 and
transferring the derivative to E1.]
(b) Suppose now that you have two separated conductors (Fig. 3.41). If you charge
up conductor a by amount Q (leaving b uncharged), the resulting potential of
b is, say, Vab . On the other hand, if you put that same charge Q on conductor b
(leaving a uncharged), the potential of a would be Vba . Use Green’s reciprocity
theorem to show that Vab = Vba (an astonishing result, since we assumed noth-
ing about the shapes or placement of the conductors).

23There are other ways of getting the delta-function term in the field of a dipole—my own favorite is
Prob. 3.49. Note that unless you are right on top of the dipole, Eq. 3.104 is perfectly adequate.
24See C. P. Frahm, Am. J. Phys. 51, 826 (1983). For applications, see D. J. Griffiths, Am. J. Phys. 50,
698 (1982). There are other (perhaps preferable) ways of expressing the contact (delta-function) term
in Eq. 3.106; see A. Gsponer, Eur. J. Phys. 28, 267 (2007), J. Franklin, Am. J. Phys. 78, 1225 (2010),

4 Electric Fields in Matter
4.1 POLARIZATION
4.1.1 Dielectrics
In this chapter, we shall study electric fields in matter. Matter, of course, comes
in many varieties—solids, liquids, gases, metals, woods, glasses—and these sub-
stances do not all respond in the same way to electrostatic fields. Nevertheless,
most everyday objects belong (at least, in good approximation) to one of two large
classes: conductors and insulators (or dielectrics). We have already talked about
conductors; these are substances that contain an “unlimited” supply of charges
that are free to move about through the material. In practice, what this ordinarily
means is that many of the electrons (one or two per atom, in a typical metal) are
not associated with any particular nucleus, but roam around at will. In dielectrics,
by contrast, all charges are attached to specific atoms or molecules—they’re on
a tight leash, and all they can do is move a bit within the atom or molecule. Such
microscopic displacements are not as dramatic as the wholesale rearrangement
of charge in a conductor, but their cumulative effects account for the characteris-
tic behavior of dielectric materials. There are actually two principal mechanisms
by which electric fields can distort the charge distribution of a dielectric atom
or molecule: stretching and rotating. In the next two sections I’ll discuss these
processes.
4.1.2 Induced Dipoles
What happens to a neutral atom when it is placed in an electric field E? Your
first guess might well be: “Absolutely nothing—since the atom is not charged, the
field has no effect on it.” But that is incorrect. Although the atom as a whole is
electrically neutral, there is a positively charged core (the nucleus) and a nega-
tively charged electron cloud surrounding it. These two regions of charge within
the atom are influenced by the field: the nucleus is pushed in the direction of the
field, and the electrons the opposite way. In principle, if the field is large enough,
it can pull the atom apart completely, “ionizing” it (the substance then becomes
a conductor). With less extreme fields, however, an equilibrium is soon estab-
lished, for if the center of the electron cloud does not coincide with the nucleus,
these positive and negative charges attract one another, and that holds the atom
together. The two opposing forces—E pulling the electrons and nucleus apart,
their mutual attraction drawing them back together—reach a balance, leaving the

atom polarized, with plus charge shifted slightly one way, and minus the other.
The atom now has a tiny dipole moment p, which points in the same direction
as E. Typically, this induced dipole moment is approximately proportional to the
field (as long as the latter is not too strong):
p= αE. (4.1)
The constant of proportionality α is called atomic polarizability. Its value
depends on the detailed structure of the atom in question. Table 4.1 lists some
experimentally determined atomic polarizabilities.
Example 4.1. A primitive model for an atom consists of a point nucleus (+q)
surrounded by a uniformly charged spherical cloud (−q) of radius a (Fig. 4.1).
Calculate the atomic polarizability of such an atom.

Solution
In the presence of an external field E, the nucleus will be shifted slightly to the
right and the electron cloud to the left, as shown in Fig. 4.2. (Because the actual
displacements involved are extremely small, as you’ll see in Prob. 4.1, it is rea-
sonable to assume that the electron cloud retains its spherical shape.) Say that
equilibrium occurs when the nucleus is displaced a distance d from the center of
the sphere. At that point, the external field pushing the nucleus to the right exactly
balances the internal field pulling it to the left: E= Ee, where Ee is the field pro-
duced by the electron cloud. Now the field at a distance d from the center of a
uniformly charged sphere is

The atomic polarizability is therefore

where v is the volume of the atom. Although this atomic model is extremely crude,
the result (Eq. 4.2) is not too bad—it’s accurate to within a factor of four or so for
many simple atoms.
For molecules the situation is not quite so simple, because frequently they
polarize more readily in some directions than in others. Carbon dioxide (Fig. 4.3),
for instance, has a polarizability of 4.5 × 10−40 C2
·m/N when you apply the field
along the axis of the molecule, but only 2 × 10−40 for fields perpendicular to
this direction. When the field is at some angle to the axis, you must resolve it
into parallel and perpendicular components, and multiply each by the pertinent
polarizability:
p= α⊥E⊥ + α∥E∥.
In this case, the induced dipole moment may not even be in the same direction
as E. And CO2 is relatively simple, as molecules go, since the atoms at least
arrange themselves in a straight line; for a completely asymmetrical molecule,
Eq. 4.1 is replaced by the most general linear relation between E and p:
px = αx x Ex + αx y Ey + αx z Ez
py = αyx Ex + αyy Ey + αyz Ez
pz = αzx Ex + αzy Ey + αzz Ez

The set of nine constants αi j constitute the polarizability tensor for the molecule.
Their values depend on the orientation of the axes you use, though it is always
possible to choose “principal” axes such that all the off-diagonal terms (αx y , αzx ,
etc.) vanish, leaving just three nonzero polarizabilities: αx x , αyy , and αzz.
Problem 4.1 A hydrogen atom (with the Bohr radius of half an angstrom) is situated
between two metal plates 1 mm apart, which are connected to opposite terminals of
a 500 V battery. What fraction of the atomic radius does the separation distance d
amount to, roughly? Estimate the voltage you would need with this apparatus to
ionize the atom. [Use the value of α in Table 4.1. Moral: The displacements we’re
talking about are minute, even on an atomic scale.]

where q is the charge of the electron and a is the Bohr radius. Find the atomic
polarizability of such an atom. [Hint: First calculate the electric field of the electron
cloud, Ee (r ); then expand the exponential, assuming r ≪ a.

Problem 4.3 According to Eq. 4.1, the induced dipole moment of an atom is pro-
portional to the external field. This is a “rule of thumb,” not a fundamental law,
and it is easy to concoct exceptions—in theory. Suppose, for example, the charge
density of the electron cloud were proportional to the distance from the center, out
to a radius R. To what power of E would p be proportional in that case? Find the
condition on ρ(r ) such that Eq. 4.1 will hold in the weak-field limit.
Problem 4.4 A point charge q is situated a large distance r from a neutral atom of
polarizability α. Find the force of attraction between them.
4.1.3 Alignment of Polar Molecules
The neutral atom discussed in Sect. 4.1.2 had no dipole moment to start with—p
was induced by the applied field. Some molecules have built-in, permanent dipole
moments. In the water molecule, for example, the electrons tend to cluster around
the oxygen atom (Fig. 4.4), and since the molecule is bent at 105◦, this leaves a
negative charge at the vertex and a net positive charge on the opposite side. (The
dipole moment of water is unusually large: 6.1 × 10−30 C·m; in fact, this is what
accounts for its effectiveness as a solvent.) What happens when such molecules
(called polar molecules) are placed in an electric field?
If the field is uniform, the force on the positive end, F+ = qE, exactly cancels
the force on the negative end, F−
= −qE (Fig. 4.5). However, there will be a
torque:
N= (r+ × F+) + (r− × F−)
= (d/2) × (qE) + (−d/2) × (−qE)= qd × E.

4.1 Polarization 171
Thus a dipole p= qd in a uniform field E experiences a torque
N= p × E. (4.4)
Notice that N is in such a direction as to line p up parallel to E; a polar molecule
that is free to rotate will swing around until it points in the direction of the applied
field.
If the field is nonuniform, so that F+ does not exactly balance F−, there will be
a net force on the dipole, in addition to the torque. Of course, E must change rather
abruptly for there to be significant variation in the space of one molecule, so this
is not ordinarily a major consideration in discussing the behavior of dielectrics.
Nevertheless, the formula for the force on a dipole in a nonuniform field is of
some interest:
F= F+ + F−
= q(E+− E−)= q(E),
where E represents the difference between the field at the plus end and the field
at the minus end. Assuming the dipole is very short, we may use Eq. 1.35 to
approximate the small change in Ex :
Ex ≡ (∇ Ex )· d,
with corresponding formulas for Ey and Ez . More compactly,
E= (d· ∇)E,
and therefore2
F= (p· ∇)E. (4.5)
For a “perfect” dipole of infinitesimal length, Eq. 4.4 gives the torque about
the center of the dipole even in a nonuniform field; about any other point N=
(p × E) + (r × F).
Problem 4.5 In Fig. 4.6, p1 and p2 are (perfect) dipoles a distance r apart. What is
the torque on p1 due to p2? What is the torque on p2 due to p1? [In each case, I want
the torque on the dipole about its own center. If it bothers you that the answers are
not equal and opposite, see Prob. 4.29.]

2In the present context, Eq. 4.5 could be written more conveniently as F= ∇(p· E). However, it is
safer to stick with (p· ∇)E, because we will be applying the formula to materials in which the dipole
moment (per unit volume) is itself a function of position and this second expression would imply
(incorrectly) that p too is to be differentiated.

4.1.4 Polarization
In the previous two sections, we have considered the effect of an external elec-
tric field on an individual atom or molecule. We are now in a position to answer
(qualitatively) the original question: What happens to a piece of dielectric material
when it is placed in an electric field? If the substance consists of neutral atoms (or
nonpolar molecules), the field will induce in each a tiny dipole moment, pointing
in the same direction as the field.3 If the material is made up of polar molecules,
each permanent dipole will experience a torque, tending to line it up along the
field direction. (Random thermal motions compete with this process, so the align-
ment is never complete, especially at higher temperatures, and disappears almost
at once when the field is removed.)
Notice that these two mechanisms produce the same basic result: a lot of little
dipoles pointing along the direction of the field—the material becomes polarized.
A convenient measure of this effect is
P ≡ dipole moment per unit volume,
which is called the polarization. From now on we shall not worry much about
how the polarization got there. Actually, the two mechanisms I described are
not as clear-cut as I tried to pretend. Even in polar molecules there will be
3In asymmetric molecules, the induced dipole moment may not be parallel to the field, but if the
molecules are randomly oriented, the perpendicular contributions will average to zero. Within a single
crystal, the orientations are certainly not random, and we would have to treat this case separately.
4.2 The Field of a Polarized Object 173
some polarization by displacement (though generally it is a lot easier to rotate a
molecule than to stretch it, so the second mechanism dominates). It’s even possi-
ble in some materials to “freeze in” polarization, so that it persists after the field
is removed. But let’s forget for a moment about the cause of the polarization, and
let’s study the field that a chunk of polarized material itself produces. Then, in
Sect. 4.3, we’ll put it all together: the original field, which was responsible for P,
plus the new field, which is due to P.
4.2 THE FIELD OF A POLARIZED OBJECT
4.2.1 Bound Charges
Suppose we have a piece of polarized material—that is, an object containing a
lot of microscopic dipoles lined up. The dipole moment per unit volume P is
given. Question: What is the field produced by this object (not the field that may
have caused the polarization, but the field the polarization itself causes)? Well,
we know what the field of an individual dipole looks like, so why not chop the
material up into infinitesimal dipoles and integrate to get the total? As usual, it’s
easier to work with the potential. For a single dipole p (Eq. 3.99),

the infinitesimal dipoles, as in Eq. 4.9, we could first find those bound charges,
and then calculate the fields they produce, in the same way we calculate the field
of any other volume and surface charges (for example, using Gauss’s law).

electret; it is the electrical analog to a bar magnet. In practice, only very special
materials—barium titanate is the most “familiar” example—will hold a permanent
electric polarization. That’s why you can’t buy electrets at the toy store.]
Problem 4.12 Calculate the potential of a uniformly polarized sphere (Ex. 4.2)
directly from Eq. 4.9.
4.2.2 Physical Interpretation of Bound Charges
In the last section we found that the field of a polarized object is identical to
the field that would be produced by a certain distribution of “bound charges,” σb
and ρb. But this conclusion emerged in the course of abstract manipulations on
the integral in Eq. 4.9, and left us with no clue as to the physical meaning of these
bound charges. Indeed, some authors give you the impression that bound charges
are in some sense “fictitious”—mere bookkeeping devices used to facilitate the
calculation of fields. Nothing could be further from the truth: ρb and σb repre-
sent perfectly genuine accumulations of charge. In this section I’ll explain how
polarization leads to these charge distributions.
The basic idea is very simple: Suppose we have a long string of dipoles, as
shown in Fig. 4.11. Along the line, the head of one effectively cancels the tail of
its neighbor, but at the ends there are two charges left over: plus at the right end
and minus at the left. It is as if we had peeled off an electron at one end and carried
it all the way down to the other end, though in fact no single electron made the
whole trip—a lot of tiny displacements add up to one large one. We call the net
charge at the ends a bound charge to remind ourselves that it cannot be removed;

FIGURE 4.12
FIGURE 4.13
in a dielectric every electron is attached to a specific atom or molecule. But apart
from that, bound charge is no different from any other kind.
To calculate the actual amount of bound charge resulting from a given polar-
ization, examine a “tube” of dielectric parallel to P. The dipole moment of the
tiny chunk shown in Fig. 4.12 is P(Ad), where A is the cross-sectional area of
the tube and d is the length of the chunk. In terms of the charge (q) at the end,
this same dipole moment can be written qd. The bound charge that piles up at the
right end of the tube is therefore
q= P A.
If the ends have been sliced off perpendicularly, the surface charge density is
q
σb =
A= P.
For an oblique cut (Fig. 4.13), the charge is still the same, but A= Aend cos θ, so
q

σb =

The effect of the polarization, then, is to paint a bound charge σb = P·
n over the
surface of the material. This is exactly what we found by more rigorous means in
Sect. 4.2.1. But now we know where the bound charge comes from.
If the polarization is nonuniform, we get accumulations of bound charge within
the material, as well as on the surface. A glance at Fig. 4.14 suggests that a diverg-
ing P results in a pileup of negative charge. Indeed, the net bound charge ρb dτ

through the surface. The latter (by the same reasoning we used before) is P·

ρb dτ = −
P· da = −

Since this is true for any volume, we have
ρb = −∇· P,
confirming, again, the more rigorous conclusion of Sect. 4.2.1.
Example 4.3. There is another way of analyzing the uniformly polarized sphere
(Ex. 4.2), which nicely illustrates the idea of a bound charge. What we have,
really, is two spheres of charge: a positive sphere and a negative sphere. With-
out polarization the two are superimposed and cancel completely. But when the
material is uniformly polarized, all the plus charges move slightly upward (the
z direction), and all the minus charges move slightly downward (Fig. 4.15). The
two spheres no longer overlap perfectly: at the top there’s a “cap” of leftover pos-
itive charge and at the bottom a cap of negative charge. This “leftover” charge is
precisely the bound surface charge σb.

Problem 4.14 When you polarize a neutral dielectric, the charge moves a bit, but
the total remains zero. This fact should be reflected in the bound charges σb and ρb.
Prove from Eqs. 4.11 and 4.12 that the total bound charge vanishes.
The Field Inside a Dielectric4
I have been sloppy about the distinction between “pure” dipoles and “physical”
dipoles. In developing the theory of bound charges, I assumed we were working
with the pure kind—indeed, I started with Eq. 4.8, the formula for the potential
of a perfect dipole. And yet, an actual polarized dielectric consists of physical
dipoles, albeit extremely tiny ones. What is more, I presumed to represent dis-
crete molecular dipoles by a continuous density function P. How can I justify
this method? Outside the dielectric there is no real problem: here we are far away
from the molecules (r is many times greater than the separation distance between
plus and minus charges), so the dipole potential dominates overwhelmingly and
the detailed “graininess” of the source is blurred by distance. Inside the dielectric,
however, we can hardly pretend to be far from all the dipoles, and the procedure I
used in Sect. 4.2.1 is open to serious challenge.
In fact, when you stop to think about it, the electric field inside matter must
be fantastically complicated, on the microscopic level. If you happen to be very
near an electron, the field is gigantic, whereas a short distance away it may be
small or may point in a totally different direction. Moreover, an instant later, as
the atoms move about, the field will have altered entirely. This true microscopic
field would be utterly impossible to calculate, nor would it be of much interest
if you could. Just as, for macroscopic purposes, we regard water as a continu-
ous fluid, ignoring its molecular structure, so also we can ignore the microscopic
4This section can be skipped without loss of continuity.
180 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter
bumps and wrinkles in the electric field inside matter, and concentrate on the
macroscopic field. This is defined as the average field over regions large enough
to contain many thousands of atoms (so that the uninteresting microscopic fluc-
tuations are smoothed over), and yet small enough to ensure that we do not wash
out any significant large-scale variations in the field. (In practice, this means we
must average over regions much smaller than the dimensions of the object itself.)
Ordinarily, the macroscopic field is what people mean when they speak of “the”
field inside matter.5
It remains to show that the macroscopic field is what we actually obtain when
we use the methods of Sect. 4.2.1. The argument is subtle, so hang on. Sup-
pose I want to calculate the macroscopic field at some point r within a dielectric
(Fig. 4.16). I know I must average the true (microscopic) field over an appropriate
volume, so let me draw a small sphere about r, of radius, say, a thousand times
the size of a molecule. The macroscopic field at r, then, consists of two parts: the
average field over the sphere due to all charges outside, plus the average due to all
charges inside:
E= Eout + Ein.
You proved in Prob. 3.47(d) that the average field (over a sphere), produced by
charges outside, is equal to the field they produce at the center, so Eout is the field
at r due to the dipoles exterior to the sphere. These are far enough away that we
can safely use Eq. 4.9:
Vout =

The dipoles inside the sphere are too close to treat in this fashion. But fortunately
all we need is their average field, and that, according to Eq. 3.105, is

5In case the notion of macroscopic fields sounds suspicious to you, let me point out that you do exactly
the same averaging whenever you speak of the density of a material.
4.3 The Electric Displacement 181
Now, by assumption, the sphere is small enough that P does not vary signif-
icantly over its volume, so the term left out of the integral in Eq. 4.17 corre-
sponds to the field at the center of a uniformly polarized sphere, to wit:−(1/3ϵ0)P
(Eq. 4.14). But this is precisely what Ein (Eq. 4.18) puts back in! The macroscopic
field, then, is given by the potential
V (r)=

ˆ

, (4.19)
where the integral runs over the entire volume of the dielectric. This is, of course,
what we used in Sect. 4.2.1; without realizing it, we were correctly calculating
the averaged, macroscopic field, for points inside the dielectric.
You may have to reread the last couple of paragraphs for the argument to sink
in. Notice that it all revolves around the curious fact that the average field over
any sphere (due to the charge inside) is the same as the field at the center of a
uniformly polarized sphere with the same total dipole moment. This means that no
matter how crazy the actual microscopic charge configuration, we can replace it
by a nice smooth distribution of perfect dipoles, if all we want is the macroscopic
(average) field. Incidentally, while the argument ostensibly relies on the spherical
shape I chose to average over, the macroscopic field is certainly independent of
the geometry of the averaging region, and this is reflected in the final answer,
Eq. 4.19. Presumably one could reproduce the same argument for a cube or an
ellipsoid or whatever—the calculation might be more difficult, but the conclusion
would be the same.
4.3.1 4.3 THE ELECTRIC DISPLACEMENT
Gauss’s Law in the Presence of Dielectrics
In Sect. 4.2 we found that the effect of polarization is to produce accumulations of
ˆ
(bound) charge, ρb = −∇· P within the dielectric and σb = P·
n on the surface.
The field due to polarization of the medium is just the field of this bound charge.
We are now ready to put it all together: the field attributable to bound charge plus
the field due to everything else (which, for want of a better term, we call free
charge, ρf ). The free charge might consist of electrons on a conductor or ions
embedded in the dielectric material or whatever; any charge, in other words, that
is not a result of polarization. Within the dielectric, the total charge density can
be written:
ρ = ρb + ρf, (4.20)
and Gauss’s law reads
ϵ0∇· E= ρ = ρb + ρf = −∇· P + ρf,
where E is now the total field, not just that portion generated by polarization.
182 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter
It is convenient to combine the two divergence terms:
∇· (ϵ0E + P)= ρf.
The expression in parentheses, designated by the letter D,
D ≡ ϵ0E + P, (4.21)
is known as the electric displacement. In terms of D, Gauss’s law reads
∇· D= ρf, (4.22)
or, in integral form,
D· da = Q fenc , (4.23)
where Q fenc denotes the total free charge enclosed in the volume. This is a par-
ticularly useful way to express Gauss’s law, in the context of dielectrics, because
it makes reference only to free charges, and free charge is the stuff we control.
Bound charge comes along for the ride: when we put the free charge in place,
a certain polarization automatically ensues, by the mechanisms of Sect. 4.1, and
this polarization produces the bound charge. In a typical problem, therefore, we
know ρf , but we do not (initially) know ρb; Eq. 4.23 lets us go right to work with
the information at hand. In particular, whenever the requisite symmetry is present,
we can immediately calculate D by the standard Gauss’s law methods.

Inside the rubber, the electric field cannot be determined, since we do not know P.
It may appear to you that I left out the surface bound charge σb in deriving
Eq. 4.22, and in a sense that is true. We cannot apply Gauss’s law precisely at the
surface of a dielectric, for here ρb blows up,6 taking the divergence of E with it.
But everywhere else the logic is sound, and in fact if we picture the edge of the
dielectric as having some finite thickness, within which the polarization tapers
off to zero (probably a more realistic model than an abrupt cut-off anyway), then
there is no surface bound charge; ρb varies rapidly but smoothly within this “skin,”
and Gauss’s law can be safely applied everywhere. At any rate, the integral form
(Eq. 4.23) is free from this “defect.”

dielectric material with a “frozen-in” polarization

6The polarization drops abruptly to zero outside the material, so its derivative is a delta function (see
Prob. 1.46). The surface bound charge is precisely this term—in this sense it is actually included in
ρb , but we ordinarily prefer to handle it separately as σb.
184 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter
(a) Locate all the bound charge, and use Gauss’s law (Eq. 2.13) to calculate the
field it produces.
(b) Use Eq. 4.23 to find D, and then get E from Eq. 4.21. [Notice that the second
method is much faster, and it avoids any explicit reference to the bound charges.]
Problem 4.16 Suppose the field inside a large piece of dielectric is E0, so that the
electric displacement is D0 = ϵ0E0 + P.
(a) Now a small spherical cavity (Fig. 4.19a) is hollowed out of the material. Find
the field at the center of the cavity in terms of E0 and P. Also find the displace-
ment at the center of the cavity in terms of D0 and P. Assume the polarization
is “frozen in,” so it doesn’t change when the cavity is excavated.
(b) Do the same for a long needle-shaped cavity running parallel to P (Fig. 4.19b).
(c) Do the same for a thin wafer-shaped cavity perpendicular to P (Fig. 4.19c).
Assume the cavities are small enough that P, E0, and D0 are essentially uniform.
[Hint: Carving out a cavity is the same as superimposing an object of the same
shape but opposite polarization.]
4.3.2 A Deceptive Parallel
Equation 4.22 looks just like Gauss’s law, only the total charge density ρ is
replaced by the free charge density ρf , and D is substituted for ϵ0E. For this
reason, you may be tempted to conclude that D is “just like” E (apart from the
factor ϵ0), except that its source is ρf instead of ρ: “To solve problems involving
dielectrics, you just forget all about the bound charge—calculate the field as you
ordinarily would, only call the answer D instead of E.” This reasoning is seduc-
tive, but the conclusion is false; in particular, there is no “Coulomb’s law” for D:
D(r) ̸=
1
4π
ˆ
r
r2 ρf (r′)dτ′
.
The parallel between E and D is more subtle than that.
For the divergence alone is insufficient to determine a vector field; you need to
know the curl as well. One tends to forget this in the case of electrostatic fields
because the curl of E is always zero. But the curl of D is not always zero.
∇ × D= ϵ0(∇ × E) + (∇ × P)= ∇ × P, (4.25)
and there is no reason, in general, to suppose that the curl of P vanishes. Some-
times it does, as in Ex. 4.4 and Prob. 4.15, but more often it does not. The
bar electret of Prob. 4.11 is a case in point: here there is no free charge any-
where, so if you really believe that the only source of D is ρf , you will be
forced to conclude that D= 0 everywhere, and hence that E= (−1/ϵ0)P inside
and E= 0 outside the electret, which is obviously wrong. (I leave it for you to
find the place where ∇ × P ̸= 0 in this problem.) Because ∇ × D ̸= 0, more-
over, D cannot be expressed as the gradient of a scalar—there is no “potential”
for D.
4.4 Linear Dielectrics 185
Advice: When you are asked to compute the electric displacement, first look for
symmetry. If the problem exhibits spherical, cylindrical, or plane symmetry, then
you can get D directly from Eq. 4.23 by the usual Gauss’s law methods. (Evidently
in such cases ∇ × P is automatically zero, but since symmetry alone dictates the
answer, you’re not really obliged to worry about the curl.) If the requisite sym-
metry is absent, you’ll have to think of another approach, and, in particular, you
must not assume that D is determined exclusively by the free charge.
4.3.3 Boundary Conditions
The electrostatic boundary conditions of Sect. 2.3.5 can be recast in terms of D.
Equation 4.23 tells us the discontinuity in the component perpendicular to an
interface:
D⊥
above− D⊥
below = σf, (4.26)
while Eq. 4.25 gives the discontinuity in parallel components:
D∥
above− D∥
below = P∥
above− P∥
below. (4.27)
In the presence of dielectrics, these are sometimes more useful than the corre-
sponding boundary conditions on E (Eqs. 2.31 and 2.32):
1
E⊥
above− E⊥
below =
σ, (4.28)
ϵ0
and
E∥
above− E∥
below = 0. (4.29)
You might try applying them, for example, to Probs. 4.16 and 4.17.
Problem 4.17 For the bar electret of Prob. 4.11, make three careful sketches: one
of P, one of E, and one of D. Assume L is about 2a. [Hint: E lines terminate on
charges; D lines terminate on free charges.]
4.4 LINEAR DIELECTRICS
4.4.1 Susceptibility, Permittivity, Dielectric Constant
In Sects. 4.2 and 4.3 we did not commit ourselves as to the cause of P; we dealt
only with the effects of polarization. From the qualitative discussion of Sect. 4.1,
though, we know that the polarization of a dielectric ordinarily results from an
electric field, which lines up the atomic or molecular dipoles. For many sub-
stances, in fact, the polarization is proportional to the field, provided E is not
too strong:
P= ϵ0χeE. (4.30)
186 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter
The constant of proportionality, χe, is called the electric susceptibility of the
medium (a factor of ϵ0 has been extracted to make χe dimensionless). The value of
χe depends on the microscopic structure of the substance in question (and also on
external conditions such as temperature). I shall call materials that obey Eq. 4.30
linear dielectrics.7
Note that E in Eq. 4.30 is the total field; it may be due in part to free charges
and in part to the polarization itself. If, for instance, we put a piece of dielectric
into an external field E0, we cannot compute P directly from Eq. 4.30; the external
field will polarize the material, and this polarization will produce its own field,
which then contributes to the total field, and this in turn modifies the polarization,
which... Breaking out of this infinite regress is not always easy. You’ll see some
examples in a moment. The simplest approach is to begin with the displacement,
at least in those cases where D can be deduced directly from the free charge
distribution.
In linear media we have
D= ϵ0E + P= ϵ0E + ϵ0χeE= ϵ0(1 + χe)E, (4.31)
so D is also proportional to E:
D= ϵE, (4.32)
where
ϵ ≡ ϵ0(1 + χe). (4.33)
This new constant ϵ is called the permittivity of the material. (In vacuum, where
there is no matter to polarize, the susceptibility is zero, and the permittivity is ϵ0.
That’s why ϵ0 is called the permittivity of free space. I dislike the term, for it
suggests that the vacuum is just a special kind of linear dielectric, in which the
permittivity happens to have the value 8.85 × 10−12 C 2/N·m2.) If you remove a
factor of ϵ0, the remaining dimensionless quantity
ϵ
ϵr ≡ 1 + χe =
(4.34)
ϵ0
is called the relative permittivity, or dielectric constant, of the material. Dielec-
tric constants for some common substances are listed in Table 4.2. (Notice that ϵr
is greater than 1, for all ordinary materials.) Of course, the permittivity and the
dielectric constant do not convey any information that was not already available
in the susceptibility, nor is there anything essentially new in Eq. 4.32; the physics
of linear dielectrics is all contained in Eq. 4.30.8
7In modern optical applications, especially, nonlinear materials have become increasingly important.
For these there is a second term in the formula for P as a function of E—typically a cubic term. In gen-
eral, Eq. 4.30 can be regarded as the first (nonzero) term in the Taylor expansion of P in powers of E.
8As long as we are engaged in this orgy of unnecessary terminology and notation, I might as well
mention that formulas for D in terms of E (Eq. 4.32, in the case of linear dielectrics) are called
constitutive relations.

Example 4.5. A metal sphere of radius a carries a charge Q (Fig. 4.20). It is
surrounded, out to radius b, by linear dielectric material of permittivity ϵ. Find
the potential at the center (relative to infinity).
Solution
To compute V , we need to know E; to find E, we might first try to locate the
bound charge; we could get the bound charge from P, but we can’t calculate P
unless we already know E (Eq. 4.30). We seem to be in a bind. What we do know
is the free charge Q, and fortunately the arrangement is spherically symmetric, so
let’s begin by calculating D, using Eq. 4.23:
D=
Q
4πr 2
(Inside the metal sphere, of course, E= P= D= 0.) Once we know D, it is a
trivial matter to obtain E, using Eq. 4.32:

Notice that the surface bound charge at a is negative (ˆ
n points outward with
respect to the dielectric, which is +ˆ
ˆ
r at b but−
r at a). This is natural, since
the charge on the metal sphere attracts its opposite in all the dielectric molecules.
It is this layer of negative charge that reduces the field, within the dielectric, from
1/4πϵ0(Q/r 2)ˆ
r to 1/4πϵ(Q/r 2)ˆ
r. In this respect, a dielectric is rather like an
imperfect conductor: on a conducting shell the induced surface charge would be
such as to cancel the field of Q completely in the region a < r < b; the dielectric
does the best it can, but the cancellation is only partial.
You might suppose that linear dielectrics escape the defect in the parallel
between E and D. Since P and D are now proportional to E, does it not fol-
low that their curls, like E’s, must vanish? Unfortunately, it does not, for the line
integral of P around a closed path that straddles the boundary between one type of
material and another need not be zero, even though the integral of E around the
same loop must be. The reason is that the proportionality factor ϵ0χe is different
on the two sides. For instance, at the interface between a polarized dielectric and
the vacuum (Fig. 4.21), P is zero on one side but not on the other. Around this
P = 0

4.4 Linear Dielectrics 189
loop P· dl ̸= 0, and hence, by Stokes’ theorem, the curl of P cannot vanish
everywhere within the loop (in fact, it is infinite at the boundary).9
Of course, if the space is entirely filled with a homogeneous10 linear dielectric,
then this objection is void; in this rather special circumstance
∇· D= ρf and ∇ × D= 0,
so D can be found from the free charge just as though the dielectric were not there:
D= ϵ0Evac,
where Evac is the field the same free charge distribution would produce in the
absence of any dielectric. According to Eqs. 4.32 and 4.34, therefore,

Conclusion: When all space is filled with a homogeneous linear dielectric, the
field everywhere is simply reduced by a factor of one over the dielectric constant.
(Actually, it is not necessary for the dielectric to fill all space: in regions where
the field is zero anyway, it can hardly matter whether the dielectric is present or
not, since there’s no polarization in any event.)
For example, if a free charge q is embedded in a large dielectric, the field it
produces is

(that’s ϵ, not ϵ0), and the force it exerts on nearby charges is reduced accord-
ingly. But it’s not that there is anything wrong with Coulomb’s law; rather, the
polarization of the medium partially “shields” the charge, by surrounding it with
bound charge of the opposite sign (Fig. 4.22).11

9Putting that argument in differential form, Eq. 4.30 and product rule 7 yield ∇ × P= −ϵ0E × (∇χe ),
so the problem arises when ∇χe is not parallel to E.
10A homogeneous medium is one whose properties (in this case the susceptibility) do not vary with
position.
11In quantum electrodynamics, the vacuum itself can be polarized, and this means that the effective
(or “renormalized”) charge of the electron, as you might measure it in the laboratory, is not its true
(“bare”) value, and in fact depends slightly on how far away you are!

Example 4.6. A parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.23) is filled with insulating
material of dielectric constant ϵr . What effect does this have on its capacitance?
Solution
Since the field is confined to the space between the plates, the dielectric will
reduce E, and hence also the potential difference V , by a factor 1/ϵr . Accordingly,
the capacitance C= Q/V is increased by a factor of the dielectric constant,
C= ϵr Cvac. (4.37)
This is, in fact, a common way to beef up a capacitor.

just as Eq. 4.1 was superseded by Eq. 4.3 for asymmetrical molecules. The nine
coefficients, χex x , χex y , . . . , constitute the susceptibility tensor.
Problem 4.18 The space between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.24)
is filled with two slabs of linear dielectric material. Each slab has thickness a, so
the total distance between the plates is 2a. Slab 1 has a dielectric constant of 2, and
slab 2 has a dielectric constant of 1.5. The free charge density on the top plate is σ
and on the bottom plate−σ.
12A medium is said to be isotropic if its properties (such as susceptibility) are the same in all
directions. Thus Eq. 4.30 is the special case of Eq. 4.38 that holds for isotropic media. Physicists tend
to be sloppy with their language, and unless otherwise indicated the term “linear dielectric” implies
“isotropic linear dielectric,” and suggests “homogeneous isotropic linear dielectric.” But technically,
“linear” just means that at any given point, and for E in a given direction, the components of P are
proportional to E—the proportionality factor could vary with position and/or direction.

In particular, unless free charge is actually embedded in the material, ρ = 0, and
any net charge must reside at the surface. Within such a dielectric, then, the
potential obeys Laplace’s equation, and all the machinery of Chapter 3 carries
over. It is convenient, however, to rewrite the boundary conditions in a way that
makes reference only to the free charge. Equation 4.26 says

I do not claim to have provided a compelling motivation for Eqs. 4.52 and
4.53—like all image solutions, this one owes its justification to the fact that it
works: it solves Poisson’s equation, and it meets the boundary conditions. Still,
discovering an image solution is not entirely a matter of guesswork. There are at
least two “rules of the game”: (1) You must never put an image charge into the
region where you’re computing the potential. (Thus Eq. 4.52 gives the potential
for z > 0, but this image charge qb is at z = −d; when we turn to the region z < 0
(Eq. 4.53), the image charge (q + qb) is at z = +d.) (2) The image charges must
add up to the correct total in each region. (That’s how I knew to use qb to account
for the charge in the region z ≤ 0, and (q + qb) to cover the region z ≥ 0.)

Problem 4.23 Find the field inside a sphere of linear dielectric material in an oth-
erwise uniform electric field E0 (Ex. 4.7) by the following method of successive
approximations: First pretend the field inside is just E0, and use Eq. 4.30 to write
down the resulting polarization P0. This polarization generates a field of its own,
E1 (Ex. 4.2), which in turn modifies the polarization by an amount P1, which fur-
ther changes the field by an amount E2, and so on. The resulting field is E0 + E1+
E2 + · · · . Sum the series, and compare your answer with Eq. 4.49.

4.4.3 Energy in Dielectric Systems
It takes work to charge up a capacitor (Eq. 2.55):
W=
1
2 C V 2
.
If the capacitor is filled with linear dielectric, its capacitance exceeds the vacuum
value by a factor of the dielectric constant,
C= ϵr Cvac,
as we found in Ex. 4.6. Evidently the work necessary to charge a dielectric-filled
capacitor is increased by the same factor. The reason is pretty clear: you have to
pump on more (free) charge, to achieve a given potential, because part of the field
is canceled off by the bound charges.
In Chapter 2, I derived a general formula for the energy stored in any electro-
static system (Eq. 2.45):
W=
ϵ0
2
E2 dτ. (4.55)
The case of the dielectric-filled capacitor suggests that this should be changed to
W=
ϵ0
2
ϵr E2 dτ =

2
D· E dτ,
in the presence of linear dielectrics. To prove it, suppose the dielectric material
is fixed in position, and we bring in the free charge, a bit at a time. As ρf is
increased by an amount ρf , the polarization will change and with it the bound
charge distribution; but we’re interested only in the work done on the incremental
free charge:
W= (ρf )V dτ. (4.56)
198 Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter
Since ∇· D= ρf, ρf = ∇· (D), where D is the resulting change in D, so
W= [∇· (D)]V dτ.
Now
∇ · [(D)V ] = [∇· (D)]V + D· (∇V ),
and hence (integrating by parts):
W= ∇ · [(D)V ] dτ + (D)· E dτ.
The divergence theorem turns the first term into a surface integral, which vanishes
if we integrate over all space. Therefore, the work done is equal to
W= (D)· E dτ. (4.57)
So far, this applies to any material. Now, if the medium is a linear dielectric,
then D= ϵE, so
1
2 (D· E)=
1
2 (ϵE2)= ϵ(E)· E= (D)· E
(for infinitesimal increments). Thus
W=
1
2
D· E dτ .
The total work done, then, as we build the free charge up from zero to the final
configuration, is

2
D· E dτ, (4.58)
as anticipated.17
It may puzzle you that Eq. 4.55, which we derived quite generally in Chap-
ter 2, does not seem to apply in the presence of dielectrics, where it is replaced
by Eq. 4.58. The point is not that one or the other of these equations is wrong,
but rather that they address somewhat different questions. The distinction is sub-
tle, so let’s go right back to the beginning: What do we mean by “the energy
of a system”? Answer: It is the work required to assemble the system. Very
W=
17In case you are wondering why I did not do this more simply by the method of Sect. 2.4.3, starting
with W=
1
2 ρf V dτ, the reason is that this formula is untrue, in general. Study the derivation of
Eq. 2.42, and you will see that it applies only to the total charge. For linear dielectrics it happens to
hold for the free charge alone, but this is scarcely obvious a priori and, in fact, is most easily confirmed
by working backward from Eq. 4.58.
4.4 Linear Dielectrics 199
well—but when dielectrics are involved, there are two quite different ways one
might construe this process:
1. 2. We bring in all the charges (free and bound), one by one, with tweezers, and
glue each one down in its proper final location. If this is what you mean by
“assemble the system,” then Eq. 4.55 is your formula for the energy stored.
Notice, however, that this will not include the work involved in stretching
and twisting the dielectric molecules (if we picture the positive and nega-
tive charges as held together by tiny springs, it does not include the spring
energy, 1
2 kx2, associated with polarizing each molecule).18
With the unpolarized dielectric in place, we bring in the free charges, one by
one, allowing the dielectric to respond as it sees fit. If this is what you mean
by “assemble the system” (and ordinarily it is, since free charge is what we
actually push around), then Eq. 4.58 is the formula you want. In this case
the “spring” energy is included, albeit indirectly, because the force you must
apply to the free charge depends on the disposition of the bound charge; as
you move the free charge, you are automatically stretching those “springs.”
Example 4.9. Solution
A sphere of radius R is filled with material of dielectric constant ϵr
and uniform embedded free charge ρf . What is the energy of this configuration?

I would like to confirm this in an explicit model. Picture the dielectric as a col-
lection of tiny proto-dipoles, each consisting of +q and−q attached to a spring
of constant k and equilibrium length 0, so in the absence of any field the positive
and negative ends coincide. One end of each dipole is nailed in position (like the
nuclei in a solid), but the other end is free to move in response to any imposed
field. Let dτ be the volume assigned to each proto-dipole (the dipole itself may
occupy only a small portion of this space).
With the field turned on, the electric force on the free end is balanced by the
spring force;19 the charges separate by a distance d: q E= kd. In our case

It is sometimes alleged that Eq. 4.58 represents the energy even for nonlinear
dielectrics, but this is false: To proceed beyond Eq. 4.57, one must assume lin-
earity. In fact, for dissipative systems the whole notion of “stored energy” loses
its meaning, because the work done depends not only on the final configuration
but on how it got there. If the molecular “springs” are allowed to have some
19Note that the “spring” here is a surrogate for whatever holds the molecule together—it includes the
electrical attraction of the other end. If it bothers you that the force is taken to be proportional to the
separation, look again at Example 4.1.

friction, for instance, then Wspring can be made as large as you like, by assem-
bling the charges in such a way that the spring is obliged to expand and con-
tract many times before reaching its final state. In particular, you get nonsensical
results if you try to apply Eq. 4.58 to electrets, with frozen-in polarization (see
Prob. 4.27).

Which (if either) is the “true” energy of the system?
4.4.4 Forces on Dielectrics
Just as a conductor is attracted into an electric field (Eq. 2.51), so too is a
dielectric—and for essentially the same reason: the bound charge tends to accu-
mulate near the free charge of the opposite sign. But the calculation of forces on
dielectrics can be surprisingly tricky. Consider, for example, the case of a slab of
linear dielectric material, partially inserted between the plates of a parallel-plate
capacitor (Fig. 4.30). We have always pretended that the field is uniform inside a
parallel-plate capacitor, and zero outside. If this were literally true, there would
be no net force on the dielectric at all, since the field everywhere would be per-
pendicular to the plates. However, there is in reality a fringing field around the
edges, which for most purposes can be ignored but in this case is responsible for
the whole effect. (Indeed, the field could not terminate abruptly at the edge of
the capacitor, for if it did, the line integral of E around the closed loop shown in
Fig. 4.31 would not be zero.) It is this nonuniform fringing field that pulls the
dielectric into the capacitor.
Fringing fields are notoriously difficult to calculate; luckily, we can avoid this
altogether, by the following ingenious method.20 Let W be the energy of the

system—it depends, of course, on the amount of overlap. If I pull the dielectric
out an infinitesimal distance d x, the energy is changed by an amount equal to the
work done:
d W= Fme d x, (4.59)
where Fme is the force I must exert, to counteract the electrical force F on the
dielectric: Fme = −F. Thus the electrical force on the slab is

F= −

d (ϵr l− χe x), (4.62)
where l is the length of the plates (Fig. 4.30). Let’s assume that the total charge
on the plates (Q= C V ) is held constant, as the dielectric moves. In terms of Q,

(The minus sign indicates that the force is in the negative x direction; the dielectric

(with Q constant), in computing the force. One then obtains
F= −

V 2 dC

which is off by a sign. It is, of course, possible to maintain the capacitor at a fixed
potential, by connecting it up to a battery. But in that case the battery also does
work as the dielectric moves; instead of Eq. 4.59, we now have
d W= Fme d x + V d Q, (4.66)
where V d Q is the work done by the battery. It follows that

the same as before (Eq. 4.64), with the correct sign.
Please understand: The force on the dielectric cannot possibly depend on
whether you plan to hold Q constant or V constant—it is determined entirely
by the distribution of charge, free and bound. It’s simpler to calculate the force
assuming constant Q, because then you don’t have to worry about work done by
the battery; but if you insist, it can be done correctly either way.
Notice that we were able to determine the force without knowing anything
about the fringing fields that are ultimately responsible for it! Of course, it’s built
into the whole structure of electrostatics that ∇ × E= 0, and hence that the fring-
ing fields must be present; we’re not really getting something for nothing here—
just cleverly exploiting the internal consistency of the theory. The energy stored
in the fringing fields themselves (which was not accounted for in this derivation)
stays constant, as the slab moves; what does change is the energy well inside the
capacitor, where the field is nice and uniform.

on itself. However, because the field of the dielectric is discontinuous at the location
of any bound surface charge, the derivative introduces a spurious delta function, and
it is safest to stick with Eext.] Use Eq. 4.69 to determine the force on a tiny sphere,

Equation 4.72 is known as the Clausius-Mossotti formula, or, in its application to

Problem 4.42 Check the Clausius-Mossotti relation (Eq. 4.72) for the gases listed
in Table 4.1. (Dielectric constants are given in Table 4.2.) (The densities here are
so small that Eqs. 4.70 and 4.72 are indistinguishable. For experimental data that
confirm the Clausius-Mossotti correction term see, for instance, the first edition of
Purcell’s Electricity and Magnetism, Problem 9.28.)23
Problem 4.43 The Clausius-Mossotti equation (Prob. 4.41) tells you how to cal-
culate the susceptibility of a nonpolar substance, in terms of the atomic polariz-
ability α. The Langevin equation tells you how to calculate the susceptibility of a
polar substance, in terms of the permanent molecular dipole moment p. Here’s how
it goes:
(a) The energy of a dipole in an external field E is u = −p· E= −p E cos θ
(Eq. 4.6), where θ is the usual polar angle, if we orient the z axis along E.
Statistical mechanics says that for a material in equilibrium at absolute temper-
ature T , the probability of a given molecule having energy u is proportional to
the Boltzmann factor,
exp(−u/kT ).
The average energy of the dipoles is therefore

where d= sin θ dθ dφ, and the integration is over all orientations (θ :
0 → π; φ : 0 → 2π). Use this to show that the polarization of a substance
containing N molecules per unit volume is
P= N p[coth(p E/kT )− (kT /p E)]. (4.73)
That’s the Langevin formula. Sketch P/N p as a function of p E/kT.
(b) Notice that for large fields/low temperatures, virtually all the molecules are
lined up, and the material is nonlinear. Ordinarily, however, kT is much greater
than p E. Show that in this régime the material is linear, and calculate its suscep-
tibility, in terms of N , p, T , and k. Compute the susceptibility of water at 20◦C,
and compare the experimental value in Table 4.2. (The dipole moment of water
is 6.1 × 10−30 C·m.) This is rather far off, because we have again neglected the
distinction between E and Eelse. The agreement is better in low-density gases,
for which the difference between E and Eelse is negligible. Try it for water vapor
at 100◦C and 1 atm.

5.1 THE LORENTZ FORCE LAW
5.1.1 Magnetic Fields
Remember the basic problem of classical electrodynamics: We have a collection
of charges q1, q2, q3, ... (the “source” charges), and we want to calculate the force
they exert on some other charge Q (the “test” charge). (See Fig. 5.1.) According
to the principle of superposition, it is sufficient to find the force of a single source
charge—the total is then the vector sum of all the individual forces. Up to now,
we have confined our attention to the simplest case, electrostatics, in which the
source charge is at rest (though the test charge need not be). The time has come
to consider the forces between charges in motion.
To give you some sense of what is in store, imagine that I set up the following
demonstration: Two wires hang from the ceiling, a few centimeters apart; when
I turn on a current, so that it passes up one wire and back down the other, the
wires jump apart—they evidently repel one another (Fig. 5.2(a)). How do we
explain this? You might suppose that the battery (or whatever drives the current)
is actually charging up the wire, and that the force is simply due to the electrical
repulsion of like charges. But this is incorrect. I could hold up a test charge near
these wires, and there would be no force on it,1 for the wires are in fact electrically
neutral. (It’s true that electrons are flowing down the line—that’s what a current
is—but there are just as many stationary plus charges as moving minus charges
on any given segment.) Moreover, if I hook up my demonstration so as to make
the current flow up both wires (Fig. 5.2(b)), they are found to attract!

(a) Currents in opposite
directions repel.
(b) Currents in same

FIGURE 5.2
Whatever force accounts for the attraction of parallel currents and the repulsion
of antiparallel ones is not electrostatic in nature. It is our first encounter with a
magnetic force. Whereas a stationary charge produces only an electric field E in
the space around it, a moving charge generates, in addition, a magnetic field B.
In fact, magnetic fields are a lot easier to detect, in practice—all you need is a
Boy Scout compass. How these devices work is irrelevant at the moment; it is
enough to know that the needle points in the direction of the local magnetic field.
Ordinarily, this means north, in response to the earth’s magnetic field, but in the
laboratory, where typical fields may be hundreds of times stronger than that, the
compass indicates the direction of whatever magnetic field is present.

212 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics
Now, if you hold up a tiny compass in the vicinity of a current-carrying wire,
you quickly discover a very peculiar thing: The field does not point toward the
wire, nor away from it, but rather it circles around the wire. In fact, if you grab
the wire with your right hand—thumb in the direction of the current—your fingers
curl around in the direction of the magnetic field (Fig. 5.3). How can such a field
lead to a force of attraction on a nearby parallel current? At the second wire, the
magnetic field points into the page (Fig. 5.4), the current is upward, and yet the
resulting force is to the left! It’s going to take a strange law to account for these
directions.
5.1.2 Magnetic Forces
In fact, this combination of directions is just right for a cross product: the magnetic
force on a charge Q, moving with velocity v in a magnetic field B, is2
Fmag = Q(v × B). (5.1)
This is known as the Lorentz force law.
3 In the presence of both electric and
magnetic fields, the net force on Q would be
F= Q[E + (v × B)]. (5.2)
I do not pretend to have derived Eq. 5.1, of course; it is a fundamental axiom
of the theory, whose justification is to be found in experiments such as the one I
described in Sect. 5.1.1.
Our main job from now on is to calculate the magnetic field B (and for that
matter the electric field E as well; the rules are more complicated when the source
charges are in motion). But before we proceed, it is worthwhile to take a closer
look at the Lorentz force law itself; it is a peculiar law, and it leads to some truly
bizarre particle trajectories.
Example 5.1. Cyclotron motion. The archtypical motion of a charged particle
in a magnetic field is circular, with the magnetic force providing the centripetal
acceleration. In Fig. 5.5, a uniform magnetic field points into the page; if the
charge Q moves counterclockwise, with speed v, around a circle of radius R,
the magnetic force points inward, and has a fixed magnitude QvB—just right to
sustain uniform circular motion:
v2
QvB= m
R, or p= Q B R, (5.3)
2Since F and v are vectors, B is actually a pseudovector.
3Actually, it is due to Oliver Heaviside.

where m is the particle’s mass and p= mv is its momentum. Equation 5.3 is
known as the cyclotron formula because it describes the motion of a particle in a
cyclotron—the first of the modern particle accelerators. It also suggests a simple
experimental technique for finding the momentum of a charged particle: send it
through a region of known magnetic field, and measure the radius of its trajectory.
This is in fact the standard means for determining the momenta of elementary
particles.
I assumed that the charge moves in a plane perpendicular to B. If it starts out
with some additional speed v∥ parallel to B, this component of the motion is
unaffected by the magnetic field, and the particle moves in a helix (Fig. 5.6). The
radius is still given by Eq. 5.3, but the velocity in question is now the component
perpendicular to B, v⊥.
Example 5.2. Cycloid Motion. A more exotic trajectory occurs if we include
a uniform electric field, at right angles to the magnetic one. Suppose, for instance,
that B points in the x-direction, and E in the z-direction, as shown in Fig. 5.7.
A positive charge is released from the origin; what path will it follow?
Solution
Let’s think it through qualitatively, first. Initially, the particle is at rest, so the mag-
netic force is zero, and the electric field accelerates the charge in the z-direction.
As it picks up speed, a magnetic force develops which, according to Eq. 5.1, pulls
the charge around to the right. The faster it goes, the stronger Fmag becomes;
eventually, it curves the particle back around towards the y axis. At this point the
charge is moving against the electrical force, so it begins to slow down—the mag-
netic force then decreases, and the electrical force takes over, bringing the particle
to rest at point a, in Fig. 5.7. There the entire process commences anew, carrying
the particle over to point b, and so on.
Now let’s do it quantitatively. There being no force in the x-direction, the posi-
tion of the particle at any time t can be described by the vector (0, y(t), z(t)); the
velocity is therefore

The particle moves as though it were a spot on the rim of a wheel rolling along the
y axis. The curve generated in this way is called a cycloid. Notice that the overall
motion is not in the direction of E, as you might suppose, but perpendicular to it.
One implication of the Lorentz force law (Eq. 5.1) deserves special attention:
Magnetic forces do no work.
For if Q moves an amount dl= v dt, the work done is
d Wmag = Fmag· dl= Q(v × B)· v dt= 0. (5.11)
This follows because (v × B) is perpendicular to v, so (v × B)· v = 0. Magnetic
forces may alter the direction in which a particle moves, but they cannot speed
it up or slow it down. The fact that magnetic forces do no work is an elementary
and direct consequence of the Lorentz force law, but there are many situations
in which it appears so manifestly false that one’s confidence is bound to waver.
When a magnetic crane lifts the carcass of a junked car, for instance, something
is obviously doing work, and it seems perverse to deny that the magnetic force
is responsible. Well, perverse or not, deny it we must, and it can be a very subtle
matter to figure out who does deserve the credit in such circumstances. We’ll see
a cute example in the next section, but the full story will have to await Chapter 8.
Problem 5.1 A particle of charge q enters a region of uniform magnetic field B
(pointing into the page). The field deflects the particle a distance d above the original
line of flight, as shown in Fig. 5.8. Is the charge positive or negative? In terms of a,
d, B and q, find the momentum of the particle.

Problem 5.3 In 1897, J. J. Thomson “discovered” the electron by measuring the
charge-to-mass ratio of “cathode rays” (actually, streams of electrons, with charge
q and mass m) as follows:
(a) First he passed the beam through uniform crossed electric and magnetic fields
E and B (mutually perpendicular, and both of them perpendicular to the beam),
and adjusted the electric field until he got zero deflection. What, then, was the
speed of the particles (in terms of E and B)?
(b) Then he turned off the electric field, and measured the radius of curvature, R,
of the beam, as deflected by the magnetic field alone. In terms of E, B, and R,
what is the charge-to-mass ratio (q/m) of the particles?
5.1.3 Currents
The current in a wire is the charge per unit time passing a given point. By def-
inition, negative charges moving to the left count the same as positive ones to
the right. This conveniently reflects the physical fact that almost all phenomena
involving moving charges depend on the product of charge and velocity—if you
reverse the signs of q and v, you get the same answer, so it doesn’t really mat-
ter which you have. (The Lorentz force law is a case in point; the Hall effect
(Prob. 5.41) is a notorious exception.) In practice, it is ordinarily the negatively
charged electrons that do the moving—in the direction opposite to the electric
current. To avoid the petty complications this entails, I shall often pretend it’s the
positive charges that move, as in fact everyone assumed they did for a century
or so after Benjamin Franklin established his unfortunate convention.5 Current is
measured in coulombs-per-second, or amperes (A):
1 A= 1 C/s. (5.12)
5If we called the electron plus and the proton minus, the problem would never arise. In the context of
Franklin’s experiments with cat’s fur and glass rods, the choice was completely arbitrary.

FIGURE 5.9
A line charge λ traveling down a wire at speed v (Fig. 5.9) constitutes a current
I= λv, (5.13)
because a segment of length vt, carrying charge λvt, passes point P in a time
interval t. Current is actually a vector:
I= λv. (5.14)
Because the path of the flow is dictated by the shape of the wire, one doesn’t
ordinarily bother to display the direction of I explicitly,6 but when it comes to
surface and volume currents we cannot afford to be so casual, and for the sake of
notational consistency it is a good idea to acknowledge the vectorial character of
currents right from the start. A neutral wire, of course, contains as many stationary
positive charges as mobile negative ones. The former do not contribute to the
current—the charge density λ in Eq. 5.13 refers only to the moving charges. In
the unusual situation where both types move, I= λ+v+ + λ−v−.
The magnetic force on a segment of current-carrying wire is
Fmag = (v × B)dq= (v × B)λ dl= (I × B)dl. (5.15)
Inasmuch as I and dl both point in the same direction, we can just as well write
this as
Fmag = I (dl × B). (5.16)
Typically, the current is constant (in magnitude) along the wire, and in that case I
comes outside the integral:
Fmag = I (dl × B). (5.17)
Example 5.3. A rectangular loop of wire, supporting a mass m, hangs vertically
with one end in a uniform magnetic field B, which points into the page in the
shaded region of Fig. 5.10. For what current I, in the loop, would the magnetic
force upward exactly balance the gravitational force downward?
6For the same reason, if you are describing a locomotive constrained to move along a specified track,
you would probably speak of its speed, rather than its velocity.
218 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics
a
m
FIGURE 5.10
Solution
First of all, the current must circulate clockwise, in order for (I × B) in the hori-
zontal segment to point upward. The force is
Fmag = I Ba,
where a is the width of the loop. (The magnetic forces on the two vertical seg-
ments cancel.) For Fmag to balance the weight (mg), we must therefore have
mg
I=
Ba. (5.18)
The weight just hangs there, suspended in mid-air!
What happens if we now increase the current? Then the upward magnetic force
exceeds the downward force of gravity, and the loop rises, lifting the weight.
Somebody’s doing work, and it sure looks as though the magnetic force is re-
sponsible. Indeed, one is tempted to write
Wmag = Fmagh= I Bah, (5.19)
where h is the distance the loop rises. But we know that magnetic forces never do
work. What’s going on here?
Well, when the loop starts to rise, the charges in the wire are no longer moving
horizontally—their velocity now acquires an upward component u, the speed of
the loop (Fig. 5.11), in addition to the horizontal component w associated with
the current (I= λw). The magnetic force, which is always perpendicular to the
velocity, no longer points straight up, but tilts back. It is perpendicular to the net
displacement of the charge (which is in the direction of v), and therefore it does
no work on q. It does have a vertical component (qwB); indeed, the net vertical
force on all the charge (λa) in the upper segment of the loop is
Fvert = λawB= I Ba (5.20)
(as before); but now it also has a horizontal component (qu B), which opposes
the flow of current. Whoever is in charge of maintaining that current, therefore,
must now push those charges along, against the backward component of the mag-
netic force.

The total horizontal force on the top segment is
Fhoriz = λau B. (5.21)
In a time dt, the charges move a (horizontal) distance w dt, so the work done by
this agency (presumably a battery or a generator) is
Wbattery = λa B uw dt= I Bah,
which is precisely what we naïvely attributed to the magnetic force in Eq. 5.19.
Was work done in this process? Absolutely! Who did it? The battery! What, then,
was the role of the magnetic force? Well, it redirected the horizontal force of the
battery into the vertical motion of the loop and the weight.7

F mop
FIGURE 5.12
It may help to consider a mechanical analogy. Imagine you’re sliding a trunk
up a frictionless ramp, by pushing on it horizontally with a mop (Fig. 5.12). The
normal force (N) does no work, because it is perpendicular to the displacement.
But it does have a vertical component (which in fact is what lifts the trunk), and
a (backward) horizontal component (which you have to overcome by pushing on
the mop). Who is doing the work here? You are, obviously—and yet your force
(which is purely horizontal) is not (at least, not directly) what lifts the box. The
7If you like, the vertical component of Fmag does work lifting the car, but the horizontal component
does equal negative work opposing the current. However you look at it, the net work done by the
magnetic force is zero.
220 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics
normal force plays the same passive (but crucial) role as the magnetic force in
Ex. 5.3: while doing no work itself, it redirects the efforts of the active agent
(you, or the battery, as the case may be), from horizontal to vertical.
When charge flows over a surface, we describe it by the surface current den-
sity, K, defined as follows: Consider a “ribbon” of infinitesimal width dl⊥, run-
ning parallel to the flow (Fig. 5.13). If the current in this ribbon is dI, the surface
current density is
dI
K ≡
dl⊥. (5.22)
In words, K is the current per unit width. In particular, if the (mobile) surface
charge density is σ and its velocity is v, then
K= σv. (5.23)
In general, K will vary from point to point over the surface, reflecting variations
in σ and/or v. The magnetic force on the surface current is
Fmag = (v × B)σ da= (K × B)da. (5.24)
Caveat: Just as E suffers a discontinuity at a surface charge, so B is discontinuous
at a surface current. In Eq. 5.24, you must be careful to use the average field, just
as we did in Sect. 2.5.3.
When the flow of charge is distributed throughout a three-dimensional region,
we describe it by the volume current density, J, defined as follows: Consider a
“tube” of infinitesimal cross section da⊥, running parallel to the flow (Fig. 5.14).
If the current in this tube is dI, the volume current density is
dI
J ≡
da⊥. (5.25)
In words, J is the current per unit area. If the (mobile) volume charge density is
ρ and the velocity is v, then
J= ρv. (5.26)

(The minus sign reflects the fact that an outward flow decreases the charge left

This is the precise mathematical statement of local charge conservation; it is called
the continuity equation.

5.2.1 Steady Currents
Stationary charges produce electric fields that are constant in time; hence the term
electrostatics.
8 Steady currents produce magnetic fields that are constant in time;
the theory of steady currents is called magnetostatics.
Stationary charges ⇒ constant electric fields: electrostatics.
Steady currents ⇒ constant magnetic fields: magnetostatics.
By steady current I mean a continuous flow that has been going on forever,
without change and without charge piling up anywhere. (Some people call
them “stationary currents”; to my ear, that’s a contradiction in terms.) Formally,
electro/magnetostatics is the régime
∂ρ
∂J
= 0,
= 0, (5.32)
∂t

at all places and all times. Of course, there’s no such thing in practice as a truly
steady current, any more than there is a truly stationary charge. In this sense,
both electrostatics and magnetostatics describe artificial worlds that exist only in
textbooks. However, they represent suitable approximations as long as the actual
fluctuations are remote, or gradual—in fact, for most purposes magnetostatics
applies very well to household currents, which alternate 120 times a second!
8Actually, it is not necessary that the charges be stationary, but only that the charge density at
each point be constant. For example, the sphere in Prob. 5.6(b) produces an electrostatic field
1/4πϵ0(Q/r 2)ˆ
r, even though it is rotating, because ρ does not depend on t.
224 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics
Notice that a moving point charge cannot possibly constitute a steady current.
If it’s here one instant, it’s gone the next. This may seem like a minor thing to
you, but it’s a major headache for me. I developed each topic in electrostatics
by starting out with the simple case of a point charge at rest; then I generalized
to an arbitrary charge distribution by invoking the superposition principle. This
approach is not open to us in magnetostatics because a moving point charge does
not produce a static field in the first place. We are forced to deal with extended
current distributions right from the start, and, as a result, the arguments are bound
to be more cumbersome.
When a steady current flows in a wire, its magnitude I must be the same all
along the line; otherwise, charge would be piling up somewhere, and it wouldn’t
be a steady current. More generally, since ∂ρ/∂t = 0 in magnetostatics, the con-
tinuity equation (5.29) becomes

The integration is along the current path, in the direction of the flow; dl′ is an

the point r (Fig. 5.17). The constant μ0 is called the permeability of free space:9
μ0 = 4π × 10−7 N/A2
. (5.35)

1 tesla = 104 gauss. The earth’s magnetic field is about half a gauss; a fairly strong laboratory magnetic
field is, say, 10,000 gauss.
5.2 The Biot-Savart Law 225
As the starting point for magnetostatics, the Biot-Savart law plays a role analo-
gous to Coulomb’s law in electrostatics. Indeed, the 1/r2 dependence is common
to both laws.
Example 5.5. Find the magnetic field a distance s from a long straight wire
carrying a steady current I (Fig. 5.18).

Equation 5.37 gives the field of any straight segment of wire, in terms of the
initial and final angles θ1 and θ2 (Fig. 5.19). Of course, a finite segment by itself
226 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics
could never support a steady current (where would the charge go when it got to
the end?), but it might be a piece of some closed circuit, and Eq. 5.37 would
then represent its contribution to the total field. In the case of an infinite wire,
θ1 = −π/2 and θ2 = π/2, so we obtain
B=
μ0 I
2πs. (5.38)
Notice that the field is inversely proportional to the distance from the wire—
just like the electric field of an infinite line charge. In the region below the wire,
B points into the page, and in general, it “circles around” the wire, in accordance
with the right-hand rule (Fig. 5.3):

but this is simply wrong.
11 As I mentioned earlier, a point charge does not con-
stitute a steady current, and the Biot-Savart law, which only holds for steady cur-
rents, does not correctly determine its field.
The superposition principle applies to magnetic fields just as it does to electric
fields: if you have a collection of source currents, the net field is the (vector) sum
of the fields due to each of them taken separately.

5.3 THE DIVERGENCE AND CURL OF B
5.3.1 Straight-Line Currents
The magnetic field of an infinite straight wire is shown in Fig. 5.27 (the current is
coming out of the page). At a glance, it is clear that this field has a nonzero curl
(something you’ll never see in an electrostatic field); let’s calculate it.
According to Eq. 5.38, the integral of B around a circular path of radius s,
centered at the wire, is
B· dl=
dl=

dl= μ0 I.
Notice that the answer is independent of s; that’s because B decreases at the same
rate as the circumference increases. In fact, it doesn’t have to be a circle; any old

that are not really there—λ and v are both measured in the laboratory frame, and this is ordinary
electrostatics.

This assumes the loop encircles the wire exactly once; if it went around twice,
then φ would run from 0 to 4π, and if it didn’t enclose the wire at all, then φ
would go from φ1 to φ2 and back again, with dφ= 0 (Fig. 5.28).
Now suppose we have a bundle of straight wires. Each wire that passes through
our loop contributes μ0 I , and those outside contribute nothing (Fig. 5.29). The
line integral will then be
where Ienc stands for the total current enclosed by the integration path. If the flow
of charge is represented by a volume current density J, the enclosed current is

with the integral taken over any surface bounded by the loop. Applying Stokes’
theorem to Eq. 5.44, then,
(∇ × B)· da = μ0 J· da,
and hence
∇ × B= μ0J. (5.46)
With minimal labor, we have actually obtained the general formula for the curl
of B. But our derivation is seriously flawed by the restriction to infinite straight
line currents (and combinations thereof). Most current configurations cannot be
constructed out of infinite straight wires, and we have no right to assume that
Eq. 5.46 applies to them. So the next section is devoted to the formal derivation
of the divergence and curl of B, starting from the Biot-Savart law itself.
The Divergence and Curl of B
The Biot-Savart law for the general case of a volume current reads
B(r)=

This formula gives the magnetic field at a point r = (x, y, z) in terms of an inte-
gral over the current distribution J(x′
, y′
, z′) (Fig. 5.30). It is best to be absolutely
explicit at this stage:
B is a function of (x, y, z),
J is a function of (x′

r= (x− x′)ˆ

The integration is over the primed coordinates; the divergence and the curl of B
are with respect to the unprimed coordinates.

But ∇ × J= 0, because J doesn’t depend on the unprimed variables, while
∇ × (ˆ
r/r2)= 0 (Prob. 1.63), so
=
∇· B= 0. (5.50)
Evidently the divergence of the magnetic field is zero.
Applying the curl to Eq. 5.47, we obtain:
∇ × B=
μ0

∇ × J ×

(I have dropped terms involving derivatives of J, because J does not depend on
x, y, z.) The second term integrates to zero, as we’ll see in the next paragraph.
The first term involves the divergence we were at pains to calculate in Chapter 1
(Eq. 1.100):

Thus

J(r′)4πδ3(r− r′)dτ′
= μ0J(r),
which confirms that Eq. 5.46 is not restricted to straight-line currents, but holds
quite generally in magnetostatics.
To complete the argument, however, we must check that the second term in
Eq. 5.52 integrates to zero. Because the derivative acts only onˆ
r/r2, we can switch
from ∇ to ∇′ at the cost of a minus sign:13

(The reason for switching from ∇ to ∇′ was to permit this integration by parts.)
But what region are we integrating over? Well, it’s the volume that appears in
the Biot-Savart law (Eq. 5.47)—large enough, that is, to include all the current.
You can make it bigger than that, if you like; J= 0 out there anyway, so it will
add nothing to the integral. The essential point is that on the boundary the cur-
rent is zero (all current is safely inside) and hence the surface integral (Eq. 5.55)
vanishes.14
5.3.3 Ampère’s Law
The equation for the curl of B,
∇ × B= μ0J, (5.56)
is called Ampère’s law (in differential form). It can be converted to integral form
by the usual device of applying one of the fundamental theorems—in this case
Stokes’ theorem:
(∇ × B)· da = B· dl= μ0 J· da.
Now, J· da is the total current passing through the surface (Fig. 5.31), which
we call Ienc (the current enclosed by the Amperian loop). Thus
B· dl= μ0 Ienc. (5.57)
14If J itself extends to infinity (as in the case of an infinite straight wire), the surface integral is still
typically zero, though the analysis calls for greater care.

FIGURE 5.31
This is the integral version of Ampère’s law; it generalizes Eq. 5.44 to arbi-
trary steady currents. Notice that Eq. 5.57 inherits the sign ambiguity of Stokes’
theorem (Sect. 1.3.5): Which way around the loop am I supposed to go? And
which direction through the surface corresponds to a “positive” current? The res-
olution, as always, is the right-hand rule: If the fingers of your right hand indicate
the direction of integration around the boundary, then your thumb defines the
direction of a positive current.
Just as the Biot-Savart law plays a role in magnetostatics that Coulomb’s law
assumed in electrostatics, so Ampère’s plays the part of Gauss’s:
Electrostatics : Coulomb → Gauss,
Magnetostatics : Biot−Savart → Ampère.
In particular, for currents with appropriate symmetry, Ampère’s law in integral
form offers a lovely and extraordinarily efficient way of calculating the magnetic
field.
Example 5.7. Find the magnetic field a distance s from a long straight wire
(Fig. 5.32), carrying a steady current I (the same problem we solved in Ex. 5.5,
using the Biot-Savart law).
Solution
We know the direction of B is “circumferential,” circling around the wire as indi-
cated by the right-hand rule. By symmetry, the magnitude of B is constant around
an Amperian loop of radius s, centered on the wire. So Ampère’s law gives
B· dl= B dl= B2πs = μ0 Ienc = μ0 I,
or
μ0 I
B=
2πs.
This is the same answer we got before (Eq. 5.38), but it was obtained this time
with far less effort.

Example 5.8. Find the magnetic field of an infinite uniform surface current
K= Kˆ
x, flowing over the x y plane (Fig. 5.33).
Solution
First of all, what is the direction of B? Could it have any x component? No: A
glance at the Biot-Savart law (Eq. 5.42) reveals that B is perpendicular to K.
Could it have a z component? No again. You could confirm this by noting that
any vertical contribution from a filament at +y is canceled by the corresponding
filament at−y. But there is a nicer argument: Suppose the field pointed away from
the plane. By reversing the direction of the current, I could make it point toward
the plane (in the Biot-Savart law, changing the sign of the current switches the sign
of the field). But the z component of B cannot possibly depend on the direction of
the current in the x y plane. (Think about it!) So B can only have a y component,
and a quick check with your right hand should convince you that it points to the
left above the plane and to the right below it.
With this in mind, we draw a rectangular Amperian loop as shown in Fig. 5.33,
parallel to the yz plane and extending an equal distance above and below the
surface. Applying Ampère’s law,
B· dl= 2Bl= μ0 Ienc = μ0 K l,
(one Bl comes from the top segment and the other from the bottom), so B=
(μ0/2)K , or, more precisely,
B=
+(μ0/2)Kˆ
y for z < 0,
−(μ0/2)Kˆ
y for z > 0.
(5.58)
Notice that the field is independent of the distance from the plane, just like the
electric field of a uniform surface charge (Ex. 2.5).
Example 5.9. Find the magnetic field of a very long solenoid, consisting of n
closely wound turns per unit length on a cylinder of radius R, each carrying a
steady current I (Fig. 5.34). [The point of making the windings so close is that
one can then pretend each turn is circular. If this troubles you (after all, there is
a net current I in the direction of the solenoid’s axis, no matter how tight the

winding), picture instead a sheet of aluminum foil wrapped around the cylin-
der, carrying the equivalent uniform surface current K= n I (Fig. 5.35). Or make
a double winding, going up to one end and then—always in the same sense—
going back down again, thereby eliminating the net longitudinal current. But, in
truth, this is all unnecessary fastidiousness, for the field inside a solenoid is huge
(relatively speaking), and the field of the longitudinal current is at most a tiny
refinement.]
Solution
First of all, what is the direction of B? Could it have a radial component? No. For
suppose Bs were positive; if we reversed the direction of the current, Bs would
then be negative. But switching I is physically equivalent to turning the solenoid
upside down, and that certainly should not alter the radial field. How about a
“circumferential” component? No. For Bφ would be constant around an Amperian
loop concentric with the solenoid (Fig. 5.36), and hence
B· dl= Bφ(2πs)= μ0 Ienc = 0,
since the loop encloses no current.
So the magnetic field of an infinite, closely wound solenoid runs parallel to the
axis. From the right-hand rule, we expect that it points upward inside the solenoid
and downward outside. Moreover, it certainly approaches zero as you go very far

FIGURE 5.37

away. With this in mind, let’s apply Ampère’s law to the two rectangular loops in
Fig. 5.37. Loop 1 lies entirely outside the solenoid, with its sides at distances a
and b from the axis:
B· dl = [B(a)− B(b)]L= μ0 Ienc = 0,
so
B(a)= B(b).
Evidently the field outside does not depend on the distance from the axis. But we
agreed that it goes to zero for large s. It must therefore be zero everywhere! (This
astonishing result can also be derived from the Biot-Savart law, of course, but it’s
much more difficult. See Prob. 5.46.)
As for loop 2, which is half inside and half outside, Ampère’s law gives
B· dl= B L= μ0 Ienc = μ0n I L ,
where B is the field inside the solenoid. (The right side of the loop contributes
nothing, since B= 0 out there.) Conclusion:
B=
μ0n Iˆ
z, inside the solenoid,
0, outside the solenoid.
(5.59)
Notice that the field inside is uniform—it doesn’t depend on the distance from
the axis. In this sense the solenoid is to magnetostatics what the parallel-plate
capacitor is to electrostatics: a simple device for producing strong uniform
fields.
Like Gauss’s law, Ampère’s law is always true (for steady currents), but it is
not always useful. Only when the symmetry of the problem enables you to pull B
outside the integral B· dl can you calculate the magnetic field from Ampère’s
law. When it does work, it’s by far the fastest method; when it doesn’t, you have
to fall back on the Biot-Savart law. The current configurations that can be handled
by Ampère’s law are
1. Infinite straight lines (prototype: Ex. 5.7).
2. Infinite planes (prototype: Ex. 5.8).
3. Infinite solenoids (prototype: Ex. 5.9).
4. Toroids (prototype: Ex. 5.10).
The last of these is a surprising and elegant application of Ampère’s law. As in
Exs. 5.8 and 5.9, the hard part is figuring out the direction of the field (which we
will now have done, once and for all, for each of the four geometries); the actual
application of Ampère’s law takes only one line.
238 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics
Example 5.10. A toroidal coil consists of a circular ring, or “donut,” around
which a long wire is wrapped (Fig. 5.38). The winding is uniform and tight
enough so that each turn can be considered a plane closed loop. The cross-
sectional shape of the coil is immaterial. I made it rectangular in Fig. 5.38 for
the sake of simplicity, but it could just as well be circular or even some weird
asymmetrical form, as in Fig. 5.39, as long as the shape remains the same all the
way around the ring. In that case, it follows that the magnetic field of the toroid is
circumferential at all points, both inside and outside the coil.

5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B 241
The trouble is, there are infinitely many surfaces that share the same boundary line.
Which one are we supposed to use?

Comparison of Magnetostatics and Electrostatics
The divergence and curl of the electrostatic field are
⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩
∇· E=
ϵ0
∇ × E= 0, ρ, (Gauss’s law);
(no name).
These are Maxwell’s equations for electrostatics. Together with the boundary
condition E → 0 far from all charges,16 Maxwell’s equations determine the field,
if the source charge density ρ is given; they contain essentially the same infor-
mation as Coulomb’s law plus the principle of superposition. The divergence and
curl of the magnetostatic field are
⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩
∇· B= 0, (no name);
∇ × B= μ0J, (Ampère’s law).
These are Maxwell’s equations for magnetostatics. Again, together with the
boundary condition B → 0 far from all currents, Maxwell’s equations determine
the magnetic field; they are equivalent to the Biot-Savart law (plus superposition).
Maxwell’s equations and the force law
F= Q(E + v × B)
constitute the most elegant formulation of electrostatics and magnetostatics.
The electric field diverges away from a (positive) charge; the magnetic field
line curls around a current (Fig. 5.44). Electric field lines originate on positive
charges and terminate on negative ones; magnetic field lines do not begin or end
anywhere—to do so would require a nonzero divergence. They typically form
closed loops or extend out to infinity.17 To put it another way, there are no point
sources for B, as there are for E; there exists no magnetic analog to electric
charge. This is the physical content of the statement ∇· B= 0. Coulomb and
others believed that magnetism was produced by magnetic charges (magnetic
monopoles, as we would now call them), and in some older books you will still
find references to a magnetic version of Coulomb’s law, giving the force of at-
traction or repulsion between them. It was Ampère who first speculated that all
magnetic effects are attributable to electric charges in motion (currents). As far
16In those artificial problems where the charge (or current) extends to infinity—infinite planes, for
example—symmetry considerations can sometimes take the place of boundary conditions.
17A third possibility turns out to be surprisingly common: they can form chaotic tangles. See
M. Lieberherr, Am. J. Phys. 78, 1117 (2010).

as we know, Ampère was right; nevertheless, it remains an open experimental
question whether magnetic monopoles exist in nature (they are obviously pretty
rare, or somebody would have found one18), and in fact some recent elementary
particle theories require them. For our purposes, though, B is divergenceless, and
there are no magnetic monopoles. It takes a moving electric charge to produce a
magnetic field, and it takes another moving electric charge to “feel” a magnetic
field.
Typically, electric forces are enormously larger than magnetic ones. That’s not
something intrinsic to the theory; it has to do with the sizes of the fundamen-
tal constants ϵ0 and μ0. In general, it is only when both the source charges and
the test charge are moving at velocities comparable to the speed of light that the
magnetic force approaches the electric force in strength. (Problems 5.13 and 5.17
illustrate this rule.) How is it, then, that we notice magnetic effects at all? The
answer is that both in the production of a magnetic field (Biot-Savart) and in its
detection (Lorentz), it is the current that matters, and we can compensate for a
smallish velocity by pouring huge amounts of charge down the wire. Ordinarily,
this charge would simultaneously generate so large an electric force as to swamp
the magnetic one. But if we arrange to keep the wire neutral, by embedding in it
an equal quantity of opposite charge at rest, the electric field cancels out, leaving
the magnetic field to stand alone. It sounds very elaborate, but of course this is
precisely what happens in an ordinary current carrying wire.
Problem 5.20
(a) Find the density ρ of mobile charges in a piece of copper, assuming each atom

(b) Calculate the average electron velocity in a copper wire 1 mm in diameter,

you carry on a long distance telephone conversation?]
18An apparent detection (B. Cabrera, Phys. Rev. Lett. 48, 1378 (1982)) has never been reproduced—
and not for want of trying. For a delightful brief history of ideas about magnetism, see Chapter 1 in
D. C. Mattis, The Theory of Magnetism (New York: Harper & Row, 1965).
5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential 243
(c) What is the force of attraction between two such wires, 1 cm apart?
(d) If you could somehow remove the stationary positive charges, what would the
electrical repulsion force be? How many times greater than the magnetic force
is it?
Problem 5.21 Is Ampère’s law consistent with the general rule (Eq. 1.46) that
divergence-of-curl is always zero? Show that Ampère’s law cannot be valid, in gen-
eral, outside magnetostatics. Is there any such “defect” in the other three Maxwell
equations?
Problem 5.22 Suppose there did exist magnetic monopoles. How would you mod-
ify Maxwell’s equations and the force law to accommodate them? If you think there
are several plausible options, list them, and suggest how you might decide experi-
mentally which one is right.
5.4 MAGNETIC VECTOR POTENTIAL
5.4.1 The Vector Potential
Just as ∇ × E= 0 permitted us to introduce a scalar potential (V ) in electrostatics,
E= −∇V ,
so ∇· B= 0 invites the introduction of a vector potential A in magnetostatics:
B= ∇ × A. (5.61)
The former is authorized by Theorem 1 (of Sect. 1.6.2), the latter by Theorem 2
(The proof of Theorem 2 is developed in Prob. 5.31). The potential formulation
automatically takes care of ∇· B= 0 (since the divergence of a curl is always
zero); there remains Ampère’s law:
∇ × B= ∇ × (∇ × A)= ∇(∇· A) − ∇2A= μ0J. (5.62)
Now, the electric potential had a built-in ambiguity: you can add to V any
function whose gradient is zero (which is to say, any constant), without altering
the physical quantity E. Likewise, you can add to A any function whose curl
vanishes (which is to say, the gradient of any scalar), with no effect on B. We can
exploit this freedom to eliminate the divergence of A:
∇· A= 0. (5.63)
To prove that this is always possible, suppose that our original potential, A0,
is not divergenceless. If we add to it the gradient of λ (A= A0 + ∇λ), the new
divergence is
∇· A= ∇· A0 + ∇2λ.
244 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics
We can accommodate Eq. 5.63, then, if a function λ can be found that satisfies
∇2λ= −∇· A0.
But this is mathematically identical to Poisson’s equation (2.24),
∇2 V= −
ρ
,
ϵ0
with ∇· A0 in place of ρ/ϵ0 as the “source.” And we know how to solve Poisson’s
equation—that’s what electrostatics is all about (“given the charge distribution,
find the potential”). In particular, if ρ goes to zero at infinity, the solution is
Eq. 2.29:
ρ
V=
1
4πϵ0
dτ′
,
r
and by the same token, if ∇· A0 goes to zero at infinity, then
λ=
1
4π
∇· A0
r
dτ′
.
If ∇· A0 does not go to zero at infinity, we’ll have to use other means to dis-
cover the appropriate λ, just as we get the electric potential by other means when
the charge distribution extends to infinity. But the essential point remains: It is
always possible to make the vector potential divergenceless. To put it the other
way around: the definition B= ∇ × A specifies the curl of A, but it doesn’t say
anything about the divergence—we are at liberty to pick that as we see fit, and
zero is ordinarily the simplest choice.
With this condition on A, Ampère’s law (Eq. 5.62) becomes
∇2A= −μ0J. (5.64)
This again is nothing but Poisson’s equation—or rather, it is three Poisson’s equa-
tions, one for each Cartesian19 component. Assuming J goes to zero at infinity,
we can read off the solution:
A(r)=
μ0
4π
J(r′)

. (5.65)
r
19In Cartesian coordinates, ∇2A= (∇2 Ax )ˆ
x + (∇2 Ay )ˆ
y + (∇2 Az )ˆ
z, so Eq. 5.64 reduces to ∇2 Ax =
−μ0 Jx , ∇2 Ay = −μ0 Jy , and ∇2 Az = −μ0 Jz . In curvilinear coordinates the unit vectors them-
selves are functions of position, and must be differentiated, so it is not the case, for example, that
∇2 Ar = −μ0 Jr . Remember that even if you plan to evaluate integrals such as 5.65 using curvilinear
coordinates, you must first express J in terms of its Cartesian components (see Sect. 1.4.1).

(If the current does not go to zero at infinity, we have to find other ways to get
A; some of these are explored in Ex. 5.12 and in the problems at the end of the
section.)
It must be said that A is not as useful as V . For one thing, it’s still a vector,
and although Eqs. 5.65 and 5.66 are somewhat easier to work with than the Biot-
Savart law, you still have to fuss with components. It would be nice if we could
get away with a scalar potential
B= −∇U, (5.67)
but this is incompatible with Ampère’s law, since the curl of a gradient is always
zero. (A magnetostatic scalar potential can be used, if you stick scrupulously
to simply-connected, current-free regions, but as a theoretical tool, it is of limited
interest. See Prob. 5.29.) Moreover, since magnetic forces do no work, A does
not admit a simple physical interpretation in terms of potential energy per unit
charge. (In some contexts it can be interpreted as momentum per unit charge.20)
Nevertheless, the vector potential has substantial theoretical importance, as we
shall see in Chapter 10.
Example 5.11. A spherical shell of radius R, carrying a uniform surface charge
σ, is set spinning at angular velocity ω ω ω. Find the vector potential it produces at
point r (Fig. 5.45).
Solution
It might seem natural to set the polar axis along ω ω ω, but in fact the integration
is easier if we let r lie on the z axis, so that ω ω ω is tilted at an angle ψ. We may
as well orient the x axis so that ω ω ω lies in the x z plane, as shown in Fig. 5.46.

If the point r lies inside the sphere, then R > r , and this expression reduces to

Example 5.12. Find the vector potential of an infinite solenoid with n turns per
unit length, radius R, and current I .
Solution
This time we cannot use Eq. 5.66, since the current itself extends to infinity. But
here’s a cute method that does the job. Notice that
A· dl= (∇ × A)· da = B· da = , (5.71)
where is the flux of B through the loop in question. This is reminiscent of
Ampère’s law in integral form (Eq. 5.57),
B· dl= μ0 Ienc.
In fact, it’s the same equation, with B → A and μ0 Ienc → . If symmetry per-
mits, we can determine A from in the same way we got B from Ienc, in
Sect. 5.3.3. The present problem (with a uniform longitudinal magnetic field
μ0n I inside the solenoid and no field outside) is analogous to the Ampère’s
law problem of a fat wire carrying a uniformly distributed current. The vector
potential is “circumferential” (it mimics the magnetic field in the analog); using a
circular “Amperian loop” at radius s inside the solenoid, we have
A· dl= A(2πs)= B· da = μ0n I (πs2),
so
μ0n I
A=

For an Amperian loop outside the solenoid, the flux is

since the field only extends out to R. Thus

If you have any doubts about this answer, check it: Does ∇ × A= B? Does
∇· A= 0? If so, we’re done.
248 Chapter 5 Magnetostatics
Typically, the direction of A mimics the direction of the current. For instance,
both were azimuthal in Exs. 5.11 and 5.12. Indeed, if all the current flows in
one direction, then Eq. 5.65 suggests that A must point that way too. Thus the
potential of a finite segment of straight wire (Prob. 5.23) is in the direction of the
current. Of course, if the current extends to infinity you can’t use Eq. 5.65 in the
first place (see Probs. 5.26 and 5.27). Moreover, you can always add an arbitrary
constant vector to A—this is analogous to changing the reference point for V , and
it won’t affect the divergence or curl of A, which is all that matters (in Eq. 5.65
we have chosen the constant so that A goes to zero at infinity). In principle you
could even use a vector potential that is not divergenceless, in which case all bets
are off. Despite these caveats, the essential point remains: Ordinarily the direction
of A will match the direction of the current.
Problem 5.23 Find the magnetic vector potential of a finite segment of straight wire
carrying a current I . [Put the wire on the z axis, from z1 to z2, and use Eq. 5.66.]
Check that your answer is consistent with Eq. 5.37.
Problem 5.24 What current density would produce the vector potential, A= kˆ
φ
(where k is a constant), in cylindrical coordinates?
Problem 5.25 If B is uniform, show that A(r)= −
1
2 (r × B) works. That is, check
that ∇· A= 0 and ∇ × A= B. Is this result unique, or are there other functions
with the same divergence and curl?
Problem 5.26
(a) By whatever means you can think of (short of looking it up), find the vector
potential a distance s from an infinite straight wire carrying a current I . Check
that ∇· A= 0 and ∇ × A= B.
(b) Find the magnetic potential inside the wire, if it has radius R and the current is
uniformly distributed.
Problem 5.27 Find the vector potential above and below the plane surface current
in Ex. 5.8.
Problem 5.28
(a) Check that Eq. 5.65 is consistent with Eq. 5.63, by applying the divergence.
(b) Check that Eq. 5.65 is consistent with Eq. 5.47, by applying the curl.
(c) Check that Eq. 5.65 is consistent with Eq. 5.64, by applying the Laplacian.
Problem 5.29 Suppose you want to define a magnetic scalar potential U (Eq. 5.67)
in the vicinity of a current-carrying wire. First of all, you must stay away from the
wire itself (there ∇ × B ̸= 0); but that’s not enough. Show, by applying Ampère’s
law to a path that starts at a and circles the wire, returning to b (Fig. 5.47), that the
scalar potential cannot be single-valued (that is, U (a) ̸= U (b), even if they repre-
sent the same physical point). As an example, find the scalar potential for an infinite

straight wire. (To avoid a multivalued potential, you must restrict yourself to simply-
connected regions that remain on one side or the other of every wire, never allowing
you to go all the way around.)
Problem 5.30 Use the results of Ex. 5.11 to find the magnetic field inside a solid
sphere, of uniform charge density ρ and radius R, that is rotating at a constant
angular velocity ω ω ω.
Problem 5.31
(a) Complete the proof of Theorem 2, Sect. 1.6.2. That is, show that any diver-
genceless vector field F can be written as the curl of a vector potential A. What
you have to do is find Ax , Ay , and Az such that (i) ∂ Az /∂y− ∂ Ay /∂z = Fx ;
(ii) ∂ Ax /∂z− ∂ Az /∂x = Fy ; and (iii) ∂ Ay /∂x− ∂ Ax /∂y= Fz . Here’s one
way to do it: Pick Ax = 0, and solve (ii) and (iii) for Ay and Az . Note that
the “constants of integration” are themselves functions of y and z—they’re
constant only with respect to x. Now plug these expressions into (i), and use
the fact that ∇· F= 0 to obtain

tion, and it would be surprising if it were—although we know that there exists
a vector whose curl is F and whose divergence is zero.]
(c) As an example, let F= yˆ

5.4.2 Boundary Conditions
In Chapter 2, I drew a triangular diagram to summarize the relations among the
three fundamental quantities of electrostatics: the charge density ρ, the electric
field E, and the potential V . A similar figure can be constructed for magnetostatics
(Fig. 5.48), relating the current density J, the field B, and the potential A. There is
one “missing link” in the diagram: the equation for A in terms of B. It’s unlikely
you would ever need such a formula, but in case you are interested, see Probs. 5.52
and 5.53.

Just as the electric field suffers a discontinuity at a surface charge, so the mag-
netic field is discontinuous at a surface current. Only this time it is the tangential
component that changes. For if we apply Eq. 5.50, in integral form,
B· da = 0,
to a wafer-thin pillbox straddling the surface (Fig. 5.49), we get
B⊥

Thus the component of B that is parallel to the surface but perpendicular to the

parallel to the current reveals that the parallel component is continuous. These
results can be summarized in a single formula:
Babove− Bbelow = μ0(K ×ˆ

whereˆ
n is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface, pointing “upward.”
Like the scalar potential in electrostatics, the vector potential is continuous

∇ × A= B, in the form

5.4.3 Multipole Expansion of the Vector Potential
If you want an approximate formula for the vector potential of a localized current
distribution, valid at distant points, a multipole expansion is in order. Remember:
the idea of a multipole expansion is to write the potential in the form of a power
series in 1/r , where r is the distance to the point in question (Fig. 5.51); if r is
sufficiently large, the series will be dominated by the lowest nonvanishing contri-
bution, and the higher terms can be ignored. As we found in Sect. 3.4.1 (Eq. 3.94),

As in the multipole expansion of V , we call the first term (which goes like 1/r ) the

and so on.

Now, the magnetic monopole term is always zero, for the integral is just the
total vector displacement around a closed loop:
dl′
= 0. (5.82)
This reflects the fact that there are no magnetic monopoles in nature (an assump-
tion contained in Maxwell’s equation ∇· B= 0, on which the entire theory of
vector potential is predicated).
In the absence of any monopole contribution, the dominant term is the dipole

Here a is the “vector area” of the loop (Prob. 1.62); if the loop is flat, a is the
ordinary area enclosed, with the direction assigned by the usual right-hand rule
(fingers in the direction of the current).

Solution
This wire could be considered the superposition of two plane square loops
(Fig. 5.53). The “extra” sides ( A B) cancel when the two are put together, since
the currents flow in opposite directions. The net magnetic dipole moment is

It is clear from Eq. 5.86 that the magnetic dipole moment is independent of
the choice of origin. You may remember that the electric dipole moment is in-
dependent of the origin only when the total charge vanishes (Sect. 3.4.3). Since
the magnetic monopole moment is always zero, it is not really surprising that the
magnetic dipole moment is always independent of origin.
Although the dipole term dominates the multipole expansion (unless m = 0)
and thus offers a good approximation to the true potential, it is not ordinarily the
exact potential; there will be quadrupole, octopole, and higher contributions. You
might ask, is it possible to devise a current distribution whose potential is “pure”
dipole—for which Eq. 5.85 is exact? Well, yes and no: like the electrical analog,
it can be done, but the model is a bit contrived. To begin with, you must take an
infinitesimally small loop at the origin, but then, in order to keep the dipole mo-
ment finite, you have to crank the current up to infinity, with the product m = I a
held fixed. In practice, the dipole potential is a suitable approximation whenever
the distance r greatly exceeds the size of the loop.
The magnetic field of a (perfect) dipole is easiest to calculate if we put m at
the origin and let it point in the z-direction (Fig. 5.54). According to Eq. 5.85, the
potential at point (r,θ,φ) is

Problem 5.40 It may have occurred to you that since parallel currents attract, the
current within a single wire should contract into a tiny concentrated stream along
the axis. Yet in practice the current typically distributes itself quite uniformly over

“nailed down,” and the negative charges (density ρ−) move at speed v (and none
of these depends on the distance from the axis), show that ρ−
= −ρ+γ2, where
γ ≡ 1/ 1− (v/c)2 and c2
= 1/μ0ϵ0. If the wire as a whole is neutral, where is the
compensating charge located?22 [Notice that for typical velocities (see Prob. 5.20),
the two charge densities are essentially unchanged by the current (since γ ≈ 1). In
plasmas, however, where the positive charges are also free to move, this so-called
pinch effect can be very significant.]

6.1 MAGNETIZATION
6.1.1 Diamagnets, Paramagnets, Ferromagnets
If you ask the average person what “magnetism” is, you will probably be told
about refrigerator decorations, compass needles, and the North Pole—none of
which has any obvious connection with moving charges or current-carrying wires.
Yet all magnetic phenomena are due to electric charges in motion, and in fact, if
you could examine a piece of magnetic material on an atomic scale you would
find tiny currents: electrons orbiting around nuclei and spinning about their axes.
For macroscopic purposes, these current loops are so small that we may treat them
as magnetic dipoles. Ordinarily, they cancel each other out because of the random
orientation of the atoms. But when a magnetic field is applied, a net alignment of
these magnetic dipoles occurs, and the medium becomes magnetically polarized,
or magnetized.
Unlike electric polarization, which is almost always in the same direction as E,
some materials acquire a magnetization parallel to B (paramagnets) and some
opposite to B (diamagnets). A few substances (called ferromagnets, in defer-
ence to the most common example, iron) retain their magnetization even after the
external field has been removed—for these, the magnetization is not determined
by the present field but by the whole magnetic “history” of the object. Permanent
magnets made of iron are the most familiar examples of magnetism, but from a
theoretical point of view they are the most complicated; I’ll save ferromagnetism
for the end of the chapter, and begin with qualitative models of paramagnetism
and diamagnetism.
6.1.2 Torques and Forces on Magnetic Dipoles
A magnetic dipole experiences a torque in a magnetic field, just as an electric
dipole does in an electric field. Let’s calculate the torque on a rectangular current
loop in a uniform field B. (Since any current loop could be built up from infinites-
imal rectangles, with all the “internal” sides canceling, as indicated in Fig. 6.1,
there is no real loss of generality here; but if you prefer to start from scratch with
an arbitrary shape, see Prob. 6.2.) Center the loop at the origin, and tilt it an angle
θ from the z axis towards the y axis (Fig. 6.2). Let B point in the z direction. The
forces on the two sloping sides cancel (they tend to stretch the loop, but they don’t

rotate it). The forces on the “horizontal” sides are likewise equal and opposite (so
the net force on the loop is zero), but they do generate a torque:
N= a F sin θˆ
x.
The magnitude of the force on each of these segments is
F= I b B,
and therefore
N= I ab B sin θˆ
x = m B sin θˆ
x,
or
N= m × B, (6.1)
where m = I ab is the magnetic dipole moment of the loop. Equation 6.1 gives
the torque on any localized current distribution, in the presence of a uniform field;
in a nonuniform field it is the exact torque (about the center) for a perfect dipole
of infinitesimal size.

268 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter
Notice that Eq. 6.1 is identical in form to the electrical analog, Eq. 4.4:
N= p × E. In particular, the torque is again in such a direction as to line the
dipole up parallel to the field. It is this torque that accounts for paramagnetism.
Since every electron constitutes a magnetic dipole (picture it, if you wish, as a
tiny spinning sphere of charge), you might expect paramagnetism to be a univer-
sal phenomenon. Actually, quantum mechanics (specifically, the Pauli exclusion
principle) tends to lock the electrons within a given atom together in pairs with
opposing spins,1 and this effectively neutralizes the torque on the combination.
As a result, paramagnetism most often occurs in atoms or molecules with an
odd number of electrons, where the “extra” unpaired member is subject to the
magnetic torque. Even here, the alignment is far from complete, since random
thermal collisions tend to destroy the order.
In a uniform field, the net force on a current loop is zero:
F= I (dl × B)= I dl × B= 0;
the constant B comes outside the integral, and the net displacement dl around a
closed loop vanishes. In a nonuniform field this is no longer the case. For example,

a short solenoid in the “fringing” region (Fig. 6.3). Here B has a radial component,

(see Prob. 6.4). Once again the magnetic formula is identical to its electrical
“twin,” if we write the latter in the form F= ∇(p· E). (See footnote to Eq. 4.5.)
If you’re starting to get a sense of déjà vu, perhaps you will have more respect
for those early physicists who thought magnetic dipoles consisted of positive and
negative magnetic “charges” (north and south “poles,” they called them), sepa-
rated by a small distance, just like electric dipoles (Fig. 6.5(a)). They wrote down
a “Coulomb’s law” for the attraction and repulsion of these poles, and devel-
oped the whole of magnetostatics in exact analogy to electrostatics. It’s not a bad
model, for many purposes—it gives the correct field of a dipole (at least, away
from the origin), the right torque on a dipole (at least, on a stationary dipole),
and the proper force on a dipole (at least, in the absence of external currents). But
it’s bad physics, because there’s no such thing as a single magnetic north pole or
south pole. If you break a bar magnet in half, you don’t get a north pole in one
hand and a south pole in the other; you get two complete magnets. Magnetism
is not due to magnetic monopoles, but rather to moving electric charges; mag-
netic dipoles are tiny current loops (Fig. 6.5(c)), and it’s an extraordinary thing,
really, that the formulas involving m bear any resemblance to the corresponding
formulas for p. Sometimes it is easier to think in terms of the “Gilbert” model of
a magnetic dipole (separated monopoles), instead of the physically correct “Am-
père” model (current loop). Indeed, this picture occasionally offers a quick and
clever solution to an otherwise cumbersome problem (you just copy the corre-
sponding result from electrostatics, changing p to m, 1/ϵ0 to μ0, and E to B). But
whenever the close-up features of the dipole come into play, the two models can
yield strikingly different answers. My advice is to use the Gilbert model, if you
like, to get an intuitive “feel” for a problem, but never rely on it for quantitative
results.

6.1.3 6.1 Magnetization 271
Effect of a Magnetic Field on Atomic Orbits
Electrons not only spin; they also revolve around the nucleus—for simplicity, let’s
assume the orbit is a circle of radius R (Fig. 6.9). Although technically this orbital
motion does not constitute a steady current, in practice the period T= 2π R/v is
so short that unless you blink awfully fast, it’s going to look like a steady current:

(The minus sign accounts for the negative charge of the electron.) Accordingly,
the orbital dipole moment (I π R2) is

Like any other magnetic dipole, this one is subject to a torque (m × B) when
you turn on a magnetic field. But it’s a lot harder to tilt the entire orbit than it is
the spin, so the orbital contribution to paramagnetism is small. There is, however,
a more significant effect on the orbital motion: The electron speeds up or slows
down, depending on the orientation of B. For whereas the centripetal acceleration
v2/R is ordinarily sustained by electrical forces alone,2

in the presence of a magnetic field there is an additional force,−e(v × B). For

Notice that the change in m is opposite to the direction of B. (An electron circling
the other way would have a dipole moment pointing upward, but such an orbit
would be slowed down by the field, so the change is still opposite to B.) Ordi-
narily, the electron orbits are randomly oriented, and the orbital dipole moments
cancel out. But in the presence of a magnetic field, each atom picks up a little
“extra” dipole moment, and these increments are all antiparallel to the field. This
is the mechanism responsible for diamagnetism. It is a universal phenomenon,
affecting all atoms. However, it is typically much weaker than paramagnetism,
and is therefore observed mainly in atoms with even numbers of electrons, where
paramagnetism is usually absent.
In deriving Eq. 6.8, I assumed that the orbit remains circular, with its original
radius R. I cannot offer a justification for this at the present stage. If the atom
is stationary while the field is turned on, then my assumption can be proved—
this is not magnetostatics, however, and the details will have to await Chapter 7
(see Prob. 7.52). If the atom is moved into the field, the situation is enormously
more complicated. But never mind—I’m only trying to give you a qualitative
account of diamagnetism. Assume, if you prefer, that the velocity remains the
same while the radius changes—the formula (Eq. 6.8) is altered (by a factor of 2),
but the qualitative conclusion is unaffected. The truth is that this classical model is
fundamentally flawed (diamagnetism is really a quantum phenomenon), so there’s
3I said (Eq. 5.11) that magnetic fields do no work, and are incapable of speeding a particle up. I stand
by that. However, as we shall see in Chapter 7, a changing magnetic field induces an electric field, and
it is the latter that accelerates the electrons in this instance.
6.1 Magnetization 273
not much point in refining the details.4 What is important is the empirical fact
that in diamagnetic materials the induced dipole moments point opposite to the
magnetic field.
6.1.4 Magnetization
In the presence of a magnetic field, matter becomes magnetized; that is, upon
microscopic examination, it will be found to contain many tiny dipoles, with a net
alignment along some direction. We have discussed two mechanisms that account
for this magnetic polarization: (1) paramagnetism (the dipoles associated with the
spins of unpaired electrons experience a torque tending to line them up parallel
to the field) and (2) diamagnetism (the orbital speed of the electrons is altered in
such a way as to change the orbital dipole moment in a direction opposite to the
field). Whatever the cause, we describe the state of magnetic polarization by the
vector quantity
M ≡ magneti c di pole moment per uni t volume. (6.9)
M is called the magnetization; it plays a role analogous to the polarization
P in electrostatics. In the following section, we will not worry about how the
magnetization got there—it could be paramagnetism, diamagnetism, or even
ferromagnetism—we shall take M as given, and calculate the field this magneti-
zation itself produces.
Incidentally, it may have surprised you to learn that materials other than the
famous ferromagnetic trio (iron, nickel, and cobalt) are affected by a magnetic
field at all. You cannot, of course, pick up a piece of wood or aluminum with a
magnet. The reason is that diamagnetism and paramagnetism are extremely weak:
It takes a delicate experiment and a powerful magnet to detect them at all. If you
were to suspend a piece of paramagnetic material above a solenoid, as in Fig. 6.3,
the induced magnetization would be upward, and hence the force downward. By
contrast, the magnetization of a diamagnetic object would be downward and the
force upward. In general, when a sample is placed in a region of nonuniform field,
the paramagnet is attracted into the field, whereas the diamagnet is repelled away.
But the actual forces are pitifully weak—in a typical experimental arrangement
the force on a comparable sample of iron would be 104 or 105 times as great.
That’s why it was reasonable for us to calculate the field inside a piece of copper
wire, say, in Chapter 5, without worrying about the effects of magnetization.5

6.2 THE FIELD OF A MAGNETIZED OBJECT
6.2.1 Bound Currents
Suppose we have a piece of magnetized material; the magnetic dipole moment per
unit volume, M, is given. What field does this object produce? Well, the vector
potential of a single dipole m is given by Eq. 5.85:
A(r)=

A(r)=

What this means is that the potential (and hence also the field) of a magnetized
object is the same as would be produced by a volume current Jb = ∇ × M
throughout the material, plus a surface current Kb = M ×ˆ
n, on the boundary.
Instead of integrating the contributions of all the infinitesimal dipoles, using
Eq. 6.11, we first determine the bound currents, and then find the field they
produce, in the same way we would calculate the field of any other volume and
surface currents. Notice the striking parallel with the electrical case: there the field
of a polarized object was the same as that of a bound volume charge ρb = −∇· P
ˆ
plus a bound surface charge σb = P·
n.
Example 6.1. Solution
Find the magnetic field of a uniformly magnetized sphere.
Choosing the z axis along the direction of M (Fig. 6.12), we have

Now, a rotating spherical shell, of uniform surface charge σ, corresponds to a
surface current density
K= σv = σωR sin θˆ

It follows, therefore, that the field of a uniformly magnetized sphere is identi-
cal to the field of a spinning spherical shell, with the identification σ Rω ω ω → M.
Referring back to Ex. 5.11, I conclude that

6It is no accident that the same factors appear in the “contact” term for the fields of electric and
magnetic dipoles (Eqs. 3.106 and 5.94). In fact, one good way to model a perfect dipole is to take the
limit (R → 0) of a polarized/magnetized sphere.

Problem 6.9 A short circular cylinder of radius a and length L carries a “frozen-in”
uniform magnetization M parallel to its axis. Find the bound current, and sketch the
magnetic field of the cylinder. (Make three sketches: one for L ≫ a, one for L ≪ a,
and one for L ≈ a.) Compare this bar magnet with the bar electret of Prob. 4.11.
Problem 6.10 An iron rod of length L and square cross section (side a) is given
a uniform longitudinal magnetization M, and then bent around into a circle with a
narrow gap (width w), as shown in Fig. 6.14. Find the magnetic field at the center
of the gap, assuming w ≪ a ≪ L. [Hint: treat it as the superposition of a complete
torus plus a square loop with reversed current.]
Physical Interpretation of Bound Currents
In the last section, we found that the field of a magnetized object is identical to the
field that would be produced by a certain distribution of “bound” currents, Jb and
Kb. I want to show you how these bound currents arise physically. This will be a
heuristic argument—the rigorous derivation has already been given. Figure 6.15
depicts a thin slab of uniformly magnetized material, with the dipoles represented
by tiny current loops. Notice that all the “internal” currents cancel: every time
there is one going to the right, a contiguous one is going to the left. However, at
the edge there is no adjacent loop to do the canceling. The whole thing, then, is
equivalent to a single ribbon of current I flowing around the boundary (Fig. 6.16).
What is this current, in terms of M? Say that each of the tiny loops has area a
and thickness t (Fig. 6.17). In terms of the magnetization M, its dipole moment

is m = Mat. In terms of the circulating current I , however, m = I a. Therefore
I= Mt, so the surface current is Kb = I /t = M. Using the outward-drawn unit
vectorˆ
n (Fig. 6.16), the direction of Kb is conveniently indicated by the cross
product:
Kb = M ×ˆ
n.
(This expression also records the fact that there is no current on the top or bottom
surface of the slab; here M is parallel toˆ
n, so the cross product vanishes.)
This bound surface current is exactly what we obtained in Sect. 6.2.1. It is a
peculiar kind of current, in the sense that no single charge makes the whole trip—
on the contrary, each charge moves only in a tiny little loop within a single atom.
Nevertheless, the net effect is a macroscopic current flowing over the surface of
the magnetized object. We call it a “bound” current to remind ourselves that every
charge is attached to a particular atom, but it’s a perfectly genuine current, and it
produces a magnetic field in the same way any other current does.
When the magnetization is nonuniform, the internal currents no longer cancel.
Figure 6.18(a) shows two adjacent chunks of magnetized material, with a larger
arrow on the one to the right suggesting greater magnetization at that point. On
the surface where they join, there is a net current in the x direction, given by
Ix = [Mz (y + d y)− Mz (y)] dz=
∂Mz
∂y
d y dz.
The corresponding volume current density is therefore

In general, then,
6.2.3 Jb = ∇ × M,
consistent, again, with the result of Sect. 6.2.1.
Incidentally, like any other steady current, Jb should obey the conservation law
5.33:
∇· Jb = 0.
Does it? Yes, for the divergence of a curl is always zero.
The Magnetic Field Inside Matter
Like the electric field, the actual microscopic magnetic field inside matter fluc-
tuates wildly from point to point and instant to instant. When we speak of “the”
magnetic field in matter, we mean the macroscopic field: the average over regions
large enough to contain many atoms. (The magnetization M is “smoothed out” in
the same sense.) It is this macroscopic field that one obtains when the methods of
Sect. 6.2.1 are applied to points inside magnetized material, as you can prove for
yourself in the following problem.
Problem 6.11 In Sect, 6.2.1, we began with the potential of a perfect dipole
(Eq. 6.10), whereas in fact we are dealing with physical dipoles. Show, by the
method of Sect. 4.2.3, that we nonetheless get the correct macroscopic field.
6.3.1 6.3 THE AUXILIARY FIELD H
Ampère’s Law in Magnetized Materials
In Sect. 6.2, we found that the effect of magnetization is to establish bound cur-
rents Jb = ∇ × M within the material and Kb = M ×ˆ
n on the surface. The field
due to magnetization of the medium is just the field produced by these bound cur-
rents. We are now ready to put everything together: the field attributable to bound
currents, plus the field due to everything else—which I shall call the free current.
The free current might flow through wires imbedded in the magnetized substance
or, if the latter is a conductor, through the material itself. In any event, the total
current can be written as
J= Jb + J f. (6.17)
There is no new physics in Eq. 6.17; it is simply a convenience to separate the
current into these two parts, because they got there by quite different means: the
280 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter
free current is there because somebody hooked up a wire to a battery—it involves
actual transport of charge; the bound current is there because of magnetization—it
results from the conspiracy of many aligned atomic dipoles.
In view of Eqs. 6.13 and 6.17, Ampère’s law can be written
1
(∇ × B)= J= J f + Jb = J f + (∇ × M),
μ0
or, collecting together the two curls:
∇ ×
μ0
B− M= J f.
The quantity in parentheses is designated by the letter H:
1
1
H ≡
B− M. (6.18)
In terms of H, then, Ampère’s law reads
μ0
∇ × H= J f, (6.19)
or, in integral form,
H· dl= I fenc , (6.20)
where I fenc
is the total free current passing through the Amperian loop.
H plays a role in magnetostatics analogous to D in electrostatics: Just as D
allowed us to write Gauss’s law in terms of the free charge alone, H permits us to
express Ampère’s law in terms of the free current alone—and free current is what
we control directly. Bound current, like bound charge, comes along for the ride—
the material gets magnetized, and this results in bound currents; we cannot turn
them on or off independently, as we can free currents. In applying Eq. 6.20, all
we need to worry about is the free current, which we know about because we put
it there. In particular, when symmetry permits, we can calculate H immediately
from Eq. 6.20 by the usual Ampère’s law methods. (For example, Probs. 6.7 and
6.8 can be done in one line by noting that H= 0.)
Example 6.2. A long copper rod of radius R carries a uniformly distributed
(free) current I (Fig. 6.19). Find H inside and outside the rod.
Solution
Copper is weakly diamagnetic, so the dipoles will line up opposite to the field.
This results in a bound current running antiparallel to I , within the wire, and
parallel to I along the surface (Fig. 6.20). Just how great these bound currents will

be we are not yet in a position to say—but in order to calculate H, it is sufficient
to realize that all the currents are longitudinal, so B, M, and therefore also H, are
circumferential. Applying Eq. 6.20 to an Amperian loop of radius s < R,

the same as for a nonmagnetized wire (Ex. 5.7). Inside the wire B cannot be
determined at this stage, since we have no way of knowing M (though in practice
the magnetization in copper is so slight that for most purposes we can ignore it
altogether).
As it turns out, H is a more useful quantity than D. In the laboratory, you
will frequently hear people talking about H (more often even than B), but you
will never hear anyone speak of D (only E). The reason is this: To build an
282 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter
electromagnet you run a certain (free) current through a coil. The current is the
thing you read on the dial, and this determines H (or at any rate, the line in-
tegral of H); B depends on the specific materials you used and even, if iron is
present, on the history of your magnet. On the other hand, if you want to set up
an electric field, you do not plaster a known free charge on the plates of a par-
allel plate capacitor; rather, you connect them to a battery of known voltage. It’s
the potential difference you read on your dial, and that determines E (or rather,
the line integral of E); D depends on the details of the dielectric you’re using. If
it were easy to measure charge, and hard to measure potential, then you’d find
experimentalists talking about D instead of E. So the relative familiarity of H,
as contrasted with D, derives from purely practical considerations; theoretically,
they’re on an equal footing.
Many authors call H, not B, the “magnetic field.” Then they have to invent a
new word for B: the “flux density,” or magnetic “induction” (an absurd choice,
since that term already has at least two other meanings in electrodynamics). Any-
way, B is indisputably the fundamental quantity, so I shall continue to call it the
“magnetic field,” as everyone does in the spoken language. H has no sensible
name: just call it “H.”7
Problem 6.12 An infinitely long cylinder, of radius R, carries a “frozen-in” magne-
tization, parallel to the axis,
M= ksˆ
z,
where k is a constant and s is the distance from the axis; there is no free current
anywhere. Find the magnetic field inside and outside the cylinder by two different
methods:
(a) As in Sect. 6.2, locate all the bound currents, and calculate the field they
produce.
(b) Use Ampère’s law (in the form of Eq. 6.20) to find H, and then get B from
Eq. 6.18. (Notice that the second method is much faster, and avoids any explicit

Problem 6.13 Suppose the field inside a large piece of magnetic material is B0, so
that H0 = (1/μ0)B0− M, where M is a “frozen-in” magnetization.
(a) Now a small spherical cavity is hollowed out of the material (Fig. 6.21). Find
the field at the center of the cavity, in terms of B0 and M. Also find H at the
center of the cavity, in terms of H0 and M.
(b) Do the same for a long needle-shaped cavity running parallel to M.
(c) Do the same for a thin wafer-shaped cavity perpendicular to M.
7For those who disagree, I quote A. Sommerfeld’s Electrodynamics (New York: Academic Press,
1952), p. 45: “The unhappy term ‘magnetic field’ for H should be avoided as far as possible. It seems
to us that this term has led into error none less than Maxwell himself . . . ”

6.3.2 A Deceptive Parallel
Equation 6.19 looks just like Ampère’s original law (Eq. 5.56), except that the
total current is replaced by the free current, and B is replaced by μ0H. As in the
case of D, however, I must warn you against reading too much into this corre-
spondence. It does not say that μ0H is “just like B, only its source is J f instead of
J.” For the curl alone does not determine a vector field—you must also know the
divergence. And whereas ∇· B= 0, the divergence of H is not, in general, zero.
In fact, from Eq. 6.18
∇· H= −∇· M. (6.23)
Only when the divergence of M vanishes is the parallel between B and μ0H
faithful.
If you think I’m being pedantic, consider the example of the bar magnet—a
short cylinder of iron that carries a permanent uniform magnetization M parallel
to its axis. (See Probs. 6.9 and 6.14.) In this case there is no free current any-
where, and a naïve application of Eq. 6.20 might lead you to suppose that H= 0,
and hence that B= μ0M inside the magnet and B= 0 outside, which is non-
sense. It is quite true that the curl of H vanishes everywhere, but the divergence
does not. (Can you see where ∇· M ̸= 0?) Advice: When you are asked to find
B or H in a problem involving magnetic materials, first look for symmetry. If the
problem exhibits cylindrical, plane, solenoidal, or toroidal symmetry, then you
can get H directly from Eq. 6.20 by the usual Ampère’s law methods. (Evidently,
in such cases ∇· M is automatically zero, since the free current alone determines
the answer.) If the requisite symmetry is absent, you’ll have to think of another
284 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter
approach, and in particular you must not assume that H is zero just because there
is no free current in sight.
6.3.3 Boundary Conditions
The magnetostatic boundary conditions of Sect. 5.4.2 can be rewritten in terms of
H and the free current. From Eq. 6.23 it follows that
H ⊥
above− H ⊥
below = −(M⊥
above− M⊥
below), (6.24)
while Eq. 6.19 says
H∥
above− H∥
below = K f ×ˆ
n. (6.25)
In the presence of materials, these are sometimes more useful than the correspond-
ing boundary conditions on B (Eqs. 5.74 and 5.76):
B⊥
above− B⊥
below = 0, (6.26)
and
B∥
above− B∥
below = μ0(K ×ˆ
n). (6.27)
You might want to check them, for Ex. 6.2 or Prob. 6.14.
Problem 6.14 For the bar magnet of Prob. 6.9, make careful sketches of M, B, and
H, assuming L is about 2a. Compare Prob. 4.17.
Problem 6.15 If J f = 0 everywhere, the curl of H vanishes (Eq. 6.19), and we can
express H as the gradient of a scalar potential W :
H= −∇W.
According to Eq. 6.23, then,
∇2 W= (∇· M),
so W obeys Poisson’s equation, with ∇· M as the “source.” This opens up all the
machinery of Chapter 3. As an example, find the field inside a uniformly magne-
tized sphere (Ex. 6.1) by separation of variables. [Hint: ∇· M= 0 everywhere ex-
cept at the surface (r = R), so W satisfies Laplace’s equation in the regions r < R
and r > R; use Eq. 3.65, and from Eq. 6.24 figure out the appropriate boundary
condition on W .]
6.4 LINEAR AND NONLINEAR MEDIA
6.4.1 Magnetic Susceptibility and Permeability
In paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials, the magnetization is sustained by the
field; when B is removed, M disappears. In fact, for most substances the mag-
netization is proportional to the field, provided the field is not too strong. For
6.4 Linear and Nonlinear Media 285
notational consistency with the electrical case (Eq. 4.30), I should express the
proportionality thus:
1
M=
χm B (incorrect!). (6.28)
μ0
But custom dictates that it be written in terms of H, instead of B:
M= χm H. (6.29)
The constant of proportionality χm is called the magnetic susceptibility; it is a
dimensionless quantity that varies from one substance to another—positive for
paramagnets and negative for diamagnets. Typical values are around 10−5 (see
Table 6.1).
Materials that obey Eq. 6.29 are called linear media. In view of Eq. 6.18,
B= μ0(H + M)= μ0(1 + χm )H, (6.30)
for linear media. Thus B is also proportional to H:8
B= μH, (6.31)
where
μ ≡ μ0(1 + χm ). (6.32)
μ is called the permeability of the material.9 In a vacuum, where there is no
matter to magnetize, the susceptibility χm vanishes, and the permeability is μ0.
That’s why μ0 is called the permeability of free space.

8Physically, therefore, Eq. 6.28 would say exactly the same as Eq. 6.29, only the constant χm would
have a different value. Equation 6.29 is a little more convenient, because experimentalists find it
handier to work with H than B.
9If you factor out μ0, what’s left is called the relative permeability: μr ≡ 1 + χm = μ/μ0. By the
way, formulas for H in terms of B (Eq. 6.31, in the case of linear media) are called constitutive
relations, just like those for D in terms of E.

FIGURE 6.22
Solution
Since B is due in part to bound currents (which we don’t yet know), we cannot
compute it directly. However, this is one of those symmetrical cases in which we
can get H from the free current alone, using Ampère’s law in the form of Eq. 6.20:
H= n Iˆ
z
(Fig. 6.22). According to Eq. 6.31, then,
B= μ0(1 + χm )n Iˆ

If the medium is paramagnetic, the field is slightly enhanced; if it’s diamagnetic,
the field is somewhat reduced. This reflects the fact that the bound surface current

is in the same direction as I , in the former case (χm > 0), and opposite in the
latter (χm < 0).
You might suppose that linear media escape the defect in the parallel between
B and H: since M and H are now proportional to B, does it not follow that
their divergence, like B’s, must always vanish? Unfortunately, it does not;10 at
the boundary between two materials of different permeability, the divergence of
M can actually be infinite. For instance, at the end of a cylinder of linear para-
magnetic material, M is zero on one side but not on the other. For the “Gaussian
pillbox” shown in Fig. 6.23, M· da ̸= 0, and hence, by the divergence theorem,
∇· M cannot vanish everywhere within it.

Incidentally, the volume bound current density in a homogeneous linear mate-

current will be at the surface.

currents, and confirm that (together, of course, with the free currents) they generate

288 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter
6.4.2 Ferromagnetism
In a linear medium, the alignment of atomic dipoles is maintained by a magnetic
field imposed from the outside. Ferromagnets—which are emphatically not lin-
ear11—require no external fields to sustain the magnetization; the alignment is
“frozen in.” Like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism involves the magnetic dipoles
associated with the spins of unpaired electrons. The new feature, which makes fer-
romagnetism so different from paramagnetism, is the interaction between nearby
dipoles: In a ferromagnet, each dipole “likes” to point in the same direction as its
neighbors. The reason for this preference is essentially quantum mechanical, and
I shall not endeavor to explain it here; it is enough to know that the correlation is
so strong as to align virtually 100% of the unpaired electron spins. If you could
somehow magnify a piece of iron and “see” the individual dipoles as tiny arrows,
it would look something like Fig. 6.25, with all the spins pointing the same way.
But if that is true, why isn’t every wrench and nail a powerful magnet? The
answer is that the alignment occurs in relatively small patches, called domains.
Each domain contains billions of dipoles, all lined up (these domains are actually
visible under a microscope, using suitable etching techniques—see Fig. 6.26), but
the domains themselves are randomly oriented. The household wrench contains an
enormous number of domains, and their magnetic fields cancel, so the wrench as
a whole is not magnetized. (Actually, the orientation of domains is not completely
random; within a given crystal, there may be some preferential alignment along
the crystal axes. But there will be just as many domains pointing one way as
the other, so there is still no large-scale magnetization. Moreover, the crystals
themselves are randomly oriented within any sizable chunk of metal.)
How, then, would you produce a permanent magnet, such as they sell in
toy stores? If you put a piece of iron into a strong magnetic field, the torque
N= m × B tends to align the dipoles parallel to the field. Since they like to stay
parallel to their neighbors, most of the dipoles will resist this torque. However,
FIGURE 6.25
11In this sense, it is misleading to speak of the susceptibility or permeability of a ferromagnet. The
terms are used for such materials, but they refer to the proportionality factor between a differential
increase in H and the resulting differential change in M (or B); moreover, they are not constants, but
functions of H.

FIGURE 6.26
at the boundary between two domains, there are competing neighbors, and the
torque will throw its weight on the side of the domain most nearly parallel to the
field; this domain will win some converts, at the expense of the less favorably ori-
ented one. The net effect of the magnetic field, then, is to move the domain bound-
aries. Domains parallel to the field grow, and the others shrink. If the field is strong
enough, one domain takes over entirely, and the iron is said to be saturated.
It turns out that this process (the shifting of domain boundaries in response to
an external field) is not entirely reversible: When the field is switched off, there
will be some return to randomly oriented domains, but it is far from complete—
there remains a preponderance of domains in the original direction. You now have
a permanent magnet.
A simple way to accomplish this, in practice, is to wrap a coil of wire around
the object to be magnetized (Fig. 6.27). Run a current I through the coil; this pro-
vides the external magnetic field (pointing to the left in the diagram). As you in-
crease the current, the field increases, the domain boundaries move, and the mag-
netization grows. Eventually, you reach the saturation point, with all the dipoles
aligned, and a further increase in current has no effect on M (Fig. 6.28, point b).
Now suppose you reduce the current. Instead of retracing the path back to
M= 0, there is only a partial return to randomly oriented domains; M decreases,
but even with the current off there is some residual magnetization (point c). The
wrench is now a permanent magnet. If you want to eliminate the remaining mag-
netization, you’ll have to run a current backwards through the coil (a negative I ).
Now the external field points to the right, and as you increase I (negatively),
290 Chapter 6 Magnetic Fields in Matter
I
FIGURE 6.27
M drops down to zero (point d). If you turn I still higher, you soon reach sat-
uration in the other direction—all the dipoles now pointing to the right (e). At
this stage, switching off the current will leave the wrench with a permanent mag-
netization to the right (point f ). To complete the story, turn I on again in the
positive sense: M returns to zero (point g), and eventually to the forward satura-
tion point (b).
The path we have traced out is called a hysteresis loop. Notice that the mag-
netization of the wrench depends not only on the applied field (that is, on I ), but
also on its previous magnetic “history.”12 For instance, at three different times in
our experiment the current was zero (a, c, and f ), yet the magnetization was dif-
ferent for each of them. Actually, it is customary to draw hysteresis loops as plots
of B against H , rather than M against I . (If our coil is approximated by a long
solenoid, with n turns per unit length, then H= n I , so H and I are proportional.
Meanwhile, B= μ0(H + M), but in practice M is huge compared to H , so to all
intents and purposes B is proportional to M.)
To make the units consistent (teslas), I have plotted (μ0 H ) horizontally
(Fig. 6.29); notice, however, that the vertical scale is 104 times greater than the
horizontal one. Roughly speaking, μ0H is the field our coil would have produced
in the absence of any iron; B is what we actually got, and compared to μ0H, it is
gigantic. A little current goes a long way, when you have ferromagnetic materials

around. That’s why anyone who wants to make a powerful electromagnet will
wrap the coil around an iron core. It doesn’t take much of an external field to
move the domain boundaries, and when you do that, you have all the dipoles in
the iron working with you.
One final point about ferromagnetism: It all follows, remember, from the
fact that the dipoles within a given domain line up parallel to one another. Ran-
dom thermal motions compete with this ordering, but as long as the temperature
doesn’t get too high, they cannot budge the dipoles out of line. It’s not surprising,
though, that very high temperatures do destroy the alignment. What is surprising
is that this occurs at a precise temperature (770◦ C, for iron). Below this temper-
ature (called the Curie point), iron is ferromagnetic; above, it is paramagnetic.
The Curie point is rather like the boiling point or the freezing point in that there is
no gradual transition from ferro- to para-magnetic behavior, any more than there
is between water and ice. These abrupt changes in the properties of a substance,
occurring at sharply defined temperatures, are known in statistical mechanics as
phase transitions.
Problem 6.20 How would you go about demagnetizing a permanent magnet (such
as the wrench we have been discussing, at point c in the hysteresis loop)? That is,
how could you restore it to its original state, with M= 0 at I= 0?

quired to keep the current flowing is a different problem, which we will confront

(d) Suppose you had a large collection of compass needles, mounted on pins at
regular intervals along a straight line. How would they point (assuming the
earth’s magnetic field can be neglected)? [A rectangular array of compass nee-
dles aligns itself spontaneously, and this is sometimes used as a demonstration
of “ferromagnetic” behavior on a large scale. It’s a bit of a fraud, however, since
the mechanism here is purely classical, and much weaker than the quantum me-
chanical exchange forces that are actually responsible for ferromagnetism.13]
More Problems on Chapter 6

Here’s a more elegant approach. First write B(r) as a Taylor expansion about the

B(r)∼
= B(r0) + [(r− r0)· ∇0]B(r0),
where r0 is the position of the dipole and ∇0 denotes differentiation with respect to
r0. Put this into the Lorentz force law (Eq. 5.16) to obtain

Problem 6.29 You are asked to referee a grant application, which proposes to deter-

or “Gilbert” dipoles (separated magnetic monopoles). The experiment will involve
a cylinder of iron (radius R and length L= 10R), uniformly magnetized along the
direction of its axis. If the dipoles are Ampère-type, the magnetization is equivalent
to a surface bound current Kb = Mˆ
φ; if they are Gilbert-type, the magnetization is
equivalent to surface monopole densities σb = ±M at the two ends. Unfortunately,
these two configurations produce identical magnetic fields, at exterior points. How-
ever, the interior fields are radically different—in the first case B is in the same
6.4 Linear and Nonlinear Media 295
general direction as M, whereas in the second it is roughly opposite to M. The ap-
plicant proposes to measure this internal field by carving out a small cavity and
finding the torque on a tiny compass needle placed inside.
Assuming that the obvious technical difficulties can be overcome, and that the
question itself is worthy of study, would you advise funding this experiment? If so,
what shape cavity would you recommend? If not, what is wrong with the proposal?

7 Electrodynamics
7.1 ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE
7.1.1 Ohm’s Law
To make a current flow, you have to push on the charges. How fast they move,
in response to a given push, depends on the nature of the material. For most sub-
stances, the current density J is proportional to the force per unit charge, f:
J= σf. (7.1)
The proportionality factor σ (not to be confused with surface charge) is an empir-
ical constant that varies from one material to another; it’s called the conductivity
of the medium. Actually, the handbooks usually list the reciprocal of σ, called
the resistivity: ρ = 1/σ (not to be confused with charge density—I’m sorry, but
we’re running out of Greek letters, and this is the standard notation). Some typical
values are listed in Table 7.1. Notice that even insulators conduct slightly, though
the conductivity of a metal is astronomically greater; in fact, for most purposes
metals can be regarded as perfect conductors, with σ = ∞, while for insulators
we can pretend σ = 0.
In principle, the force that drives the charges to produce the current could be
anything—chemical, gravitational, or trained ants with tiny harnesses. For our
purposes, though, it’s usually an electromagnetic force that does the job. In this
case Eq. 7.1 becomes
J= σ(E + v × B). (7.2)
Ordinarily, the velocity of the charges is sufficiently small that the second term
can be ignored:
J= σE. (7.3)
(However, in plasmas, for instance, the magnetic contribution to f can be signif-
icant.) Equation 7.3 is called Ohm’s law, though the physics behind it is really
contained in Eq. 7.1, of which 7.3 is just a special case.
I know: you’re confused because I said E= 0 inside a conductor (Sect. 2.5.1).
But that’s for stationary charges (J= 0). Moreover, for perfect conductors

E= J/σ= 0 even if current is flowing. In practice, metals are such good con-
ductors that the electric field required to drive current in them is negligible. Thus
we routinely treat the connecting wires in electric circuits (for example) as equipo-
tentials. Resistors, by contrast, are made from poorly conducting materials.
Example 7.1. A cylindrical resistor of cross-sectional area A and length L is
made from material with conductivity σ. (See Fig. 7.1; as indicated, the cross
section need not be circular, but I do assume it is the same all the way down.) If we
stipulate that the potential is constant over each end, and the potential difference
between the ends is V , what current flows?

As it turns out, the electric field is uniform within the wire (I’ll prove this in a

Example 7.2. Two long coaxial metal cylinders (radii a and b) are separated

As these examples illustrate, the total current flowing from one electrode to
the other is proportional to the potential difference between them:
V= I R. (7.4)
This, of course, is the more familiar version of Ohm’s law. The constant of propor-
tionality R is called the resistance; it’s a function of the geometry of the arrange-
ment and the conductivity of the medium between the electrodes. (In Ex. 7.1,
R= (L/σ A); in Ex. 7.2, R= ln (b/a)/2πσ L.) Resistance is measured in ohms
( ): an ohm is a volt per ampere. Notice that the proportionality between V and I
7.1 Electromotive Force 299
is a direct consequence of Eq. 7.3: if you want to double V , you simply double the
charge on the electrodes—that doubles E, which (for an ohmic material) doubles
J, which doubles I .
For steady currents and uniform conductivity,
1
∇· E=
∇· J= 0, (7.5)
σ
(Eq. 5.33), and therefore the charge density is zero; any unbalanced charge re-
sides on the surface. (We proved this long ago, for the case of stationary charges,
using the fact that E= 0; evidently, it is still true when the charges are allowed
to move.) It follows, in particular, that Laplace’s equation holds within a homo-
geneous ohmic material carrying a steady current, so all the tools and tricks of
Chapter 3 are available for calculating the potential.
I asserted that the field in Ex. 7.1 is uniform. Let’s prove it.
Example 7.3. Solution
Within the cylinder V obeys Laplace’s equation. What are the boundary condi-
tions? At the left end the potential is constant—we may as well set it equal to
zero. At the right end the potential is likewise constant—call it V0. On the cylin-
ˆ
drical surface, J·
n = 0, or else charge would be leaking out into the surround-
ˆ
ing space (which we take to be nonconducting). Therefore E·
n = 0, and hence
∂V /∂n = 0. With V or its normal derivative specified on all surfaces, the poten-
tial is uniquely determined (Prob. 3.5). But it’s easy to guess one potential that
obeys Laplace’s equation and fits these boundary conditions:
V0 z
V (z)=
L,
where z is measured along the axis. The uniqueness theorem guarantees that this
is the solution. The corresponding field is
E= −∇V= −

which is indeed uniform.

material is removed, leaving only a metal plate at either end (Fig. 7.3). Evidently

in the present case charge arranges itself over the surface of the wire in just such
a way as to produce a nice uniform field within.1
I don’t suppose there is any formula in physics more familiar than Ohm’s law,
and yet it’s not really a true law, in the sense of Coulomb’s or Ampère’s; rather,
it is a “rule of thumb” that applies pretty well to many substances. You’re not
going to win a Nobel prize for finding an exception. In fact, when you stop to
think about it, it’s a little surprising that Ohm’s law ever holds. After all, a given
field E produces a force qE (on a charge q), and according to Newton’s second
law, the charge will accelerate. But if the charges are accelerating, why doesn’t
the current increase with time, growing larger and larger the longer you leave
the field on? Ohm’s law implies, on the contrary, that a constant field produces a
constant current, which suggests a constant velocity. Isn’t that a contradiction to
Newton’s law?
No, for we are forgetting the frequent collisions electrons make as they pass
down the wire. It’s a little like this: Suppose you’re driving down a street with
a stop sign at every intersection, so that, although you accelerate constantly in
between, you are obliged to start all over again with each new block. Your average
speed is then a constant, in spite of the fact that (save for the periodic abrupt stops)
you are always accelerating. If the length of a block is λ and your acceleration is
a, the time it takes to go a block is
t =
2λ
,
a
and hence your average velocity is
vave =
1
2
at =
λa
2.
But wait! That’s no good either! It says that the velocity is proportional to the
square root of the acceleration, and therefore that the current should be propor-
tional to the square root of the field! There’s another twist to the story: In practice,
the charges are already moving very fast because of their thermal energy. But the
thermal velocities have random directions, and average to zero. The drift velocity
we are concerned with is a tiny extra bit (Prob. 5.20). So the time between col-
lisions is actually much shorter than we supposed; if we assume for the sake of
argument that all charges travel the same distance λ between collisions, then

1Calculating this surface charge is not easy. See, for example, J. D. Jackson, Am. J. Phys. 64, 855

I don’t claim that the term in parentheses is an accurate formula for the con-
ductivity,2 but it does indicate the basic ingredients, and it correctly predicts that
conductivity is proportional to the density of the moving charges and (ordinarily)
decreases with increasing temperature.
As a result of all the collisions, the work done by the electrical force is con-
verted into heat in the resistor. Since the work done per unit charge is V and the
charge flowing per unit time is I , the power delivered is
P= V I= I 2 R. (7.7)
This is the Joule heating law. With I in amperes and R in ohms, P comes out in
watts (joules per second).
Problem 7.1 Two concentric metal spherical shells, of radius a and b, respectively,
are separated by weakly conducting material of conductivity σ (Fig. 7.4a).
(a) If they are maintained at a potential difference V , what current flows from one
to the other?
(b) What is the resistance between the shells?
(c) Notice that if b ≫ a the outer radius (b) is irrelevant. How do you account
for that? Exploit this observation to determine the current flowing between two
metal spheres, each of radius a, immersed deep in the sea and held quite far apart
(Fig. 7.4b), if the potential difference between them is V . (This arrangement can
be used to measure the conductivity of sea water.)

Ex. 7.2 is not uniform; specifically, σ(s)= k/s, for some constant k. Find the re-
sistance between the cylinders. [Hint: Because σ is a function of position, Eq. 7.5
does not hold, the charge density is not zero in the resistive medium, and E does
not go like 1/s. But we do know that for steady currents I is the same across each
cylindrical surface. Take it from there.]
7.1.2 Electromotive Force
If you think about a typical electric circuit—a battery hooked up to a light bulb,
say (Fig. 7.7)—a perplexing question arises: In practice, the current is the same all
the way around the loop; why is this the case, when the only obvious driving force
is inside the battery? Off hand, you might expect a large current in the battery and
none at all in the lamp. Who’s doing the pushing, in the rest of the circuit, and how
does it happen that this push is exactly right to produce the same current in each
segment? What’s more, given that the charges in a typical wire move (literally)
at a snail’s pace (see Prob. 5.20), why doesn’t it take half an hour for the current
to reach the light bulb? How do all the charges know to start moving at the same
instant?
Answer: If the current were not the same all the way around (for instance, dur-
ing the first split second after the switch is closed), then charge would be piling up
somewhere, and—here’s the crucial point—the electric field of this accumulating
charge is in such a direction as to even out the flow. Suppose, for instance, that
the current into the bend in Fig. 7.8 is greater than the current out. Then charge
piles up at the “knee,” and this produces a field aiming away from the kink.3 This
field opposes the current flowing in (slowing it down) and promotes the current
flowing out (speeding it up) until these currents are equal, at which point there is
no further accumulation of charge, and equilibrium is established. It’s a beautiful
system, automatically self-correcting to keep the current uniform, and it does it
all so quickly that, in practice, you can safely assume the current is the same all
around the circuit, even in systems that oscillate at radio frequencies.

3The amount of charge involved is surprisingly small—see W. G. V. Rosser, Am. J. Phys. 38, 265

and A. Nassar, Am. J. Phys. 78, 1432 (2010).
304 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics
There are really two forces involved in driving current around a circuit: the
source, fs , which is ordinarily confined to one portion of the loop (a battery, say),
and an electrostatic force, which serves to smooth out the flow and communicate
the influence of the source to distant parts of the circuit:
f= fs + E. (7.8)
The physical agency responsible for fs can be many different things: in a battery
it’s a chemical force; in a piezoelectric crystal mechanical pressure is converted
into an electrical impulse; in a thermocouple it’s a temperature gradient that does
the job; in a photoelectric cell it’s light; and in a Van de Graaff generator the
electrons are literally loaded onto a conveyer belt and swept along. Whatever the
mechanism, its net effect is determined by the line integral of f around the circuit:
E ≡ f· dl= fs· dl. (7.9)
(Because E· dl= 0 for electrostatic fields, it doesn’t matter whether you use
f or fs .) E is called the electromotive force, or emf, of the circuit. It’s a lousy
term, since this is not a force at all—it’s the integral of a force per unit charge.
Some people prefer the word electromotance, but emf is so established that I
think we’d better stick with it.
Within an ideal source of emf (a resistanceless battery,4 for instance), the net
force on the charges is zero (Eq. 7.1 with σ = ∞), so E= −fs . The potential
difference between the terminals (a and b) is therefore
V= −
b
a
E· dl=
b
a
fs· dl= fs· dl= E (7.10)
(we can extend the integral to the entire loop because fs = 0 outside the source).
The function of a battery, then, is to establish and maintain a voltage difference
equal to the electromotive force (a 6 V battery, for example, holds the positive ter-
minal 6 V above the negative terminal). The resulting electrostatic field drives cur-
rent around the rest of the circuit (notice, however, that inside the battery fs drives
current in the direction opposite to E).5
Because it’s the line integral of fs , E can be interpreted as the work done per
unit charge, by the source—indeed, in some books electromotive force is defined
this way. However, as you’ll see in the next section, there is some subtlety in-
volved in this interpretation, so I prefer Eq. 7.9.
4Real batteries have a certain internal resistance, r , and the potential difference between their termi-
nals is E− I r , when a current I is flowing. For an illuminating discussion of how batteries work, see
D. Roberts, Am. J. Phys. 51, 829 (1983).
5Current in an electric circuit is somewhat analogous to the flow of water in a closed system of pipes,
with gravity playing the role of the electrostatic field, and a pump (lifting the water up against gravity)
in the role of the battery. In this story height is analogous to voltage.
7.1 Electromotive Force 305
Problem 7.5 A battery of emf E and internal resistance r is hooked up to a variable
“load” resistance, R. If you want to deliver the maximum possible power to the
load, what resistance R should you choose? (You can’t change E and r , of course.)

Problem 7.6 A rectangular loop of wire is situated so that one end (height h) is
between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 7.9), oriented parallel to the
field E. The other end is way outside, where the field is essentially zero. What
is the emf in this loop? If the total resistance is R, what current flows? Explain.
[Warning: This is a trick question, so be careful; if you have invented a perpetual
motion machine, there’s probably something wrong with it.]
7.1.3 Motional emf
In the last section, I listed several possible sources of electromotive force, batteries
being the most familiar. But I did not mention the commonest one of all: the
generator. Generators exploit motional emfs, which arise when you move a wire
through a magnetic field. Figure 7.10 suggests a primitive model for a generator.
In the shaded region there is a uniform magnetic field B, pointing into the page,
and the resistor R represents whatever it is (maybe a light bulb or a toaster) we’re
trying to drive current through. If the entire loop is pulled to the right with speed v,
the charges in segment ab experience a magnetic force whose vertical component
qvB drives current around the loop, in the clockwise direction. The emf is
E= fmag· dl= vBh, (7.11)
where h is the width of the loop. (The horizontal segments bc and ad contribute
nothing, since the force there is perpendicular to the wire.)
Notice that the integral you perform to calculate E (Eq. 7.9 or 7.11) is carried
out at one instant of time—take a “snapshot” of the loop, if you like, and work
b

FIGURE 7.10
306 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics
from that. Thus dl, for the segment ab in Fig. 7.10, points straight up, even though
the loop is moving to the right. You can’t quarrel with this—it’s simply the way
emf is defined—but it is important to be clear about it.
In particular, although the magnetic force is responsible for establishing the
emf, it is not doing any work—magnetic forces never do work. Who, then, is
supplying the energy that heats the resistor? Answer: The person who’s pulling on
the loop. With the current flowing, the free charges in segment ab have a vertical
velocity (call it u) in addition to the horizontal velocity v they inherit from the
motion of the loop. Accordingly, the magnetic force has a component qu B to the
left. To counteract this, the person pulling on the wire must exert a force per unit
charge
fpull = u B
to the right (Fig. 7.11). This force is transmitted to the charge by the structure of
the wire.
Meanwhile, the particle is actually moving in the direction of the resultant ve-
locity w, and the distance it goes is (h/cos θ). The work done per unit charge is
therefore
fpull· dl= (u B)
h
cos θ
sin θ= vBh= E
(sin θ coming from the dot product). As it turns out, then, the work done per unit
charge is exactly equal to the emf, though the integrals are taken along entirely
different paths (Fig. 7.12), and completely different forces are involved. To calcu-
late the emf, you integrate around the loop at one instant, but to calculate the work
done you follow a charge in its journey around the loop; fpull contributes nothing to
the emf, because it is perpendicular to the wire, whereas fmag contributes nothing
to work because it is perpendicular to the motion of the charge.6
There is a particularly nice way of expressing the emf generated in a moving
loop. Let be the flux of B through the loop:

For the rectangular loop in Fig. 7.10,
As the loop moves, the flux decreases:
d

dt= −Bhv.
(The minus sign accounts for the fact that d x/dt is negative.) But this is precisely
the emf (Eq. 7.11); evidently the emf generated in the loop is minus the rate of
change of flux through the loop:
d
E= −
dt. (7.13)
This is the flux rule for motional emf.
Apart from its delightful simplicity, the flux rule has the virtue of applying to
nonrectangular loops moving in arbitrary directions through nonuniform mag-
netic fields; in fact, the loop need not even maintain a fixed shape.
Proof. Figure 7.13 shows a loop of wire at time t, and also a short time dt later.
Suppose we compute the flux at time t, using surface S, and the flux at time
t + dt, using the surface consisting of S plus the “ribbon” that connects the new
position of the loop to the old. The change in flux, then, is
d= (t + dt)− (t)= ribbon =

B· da.
Focus your attention on point P: in time dt, it moves to P′. Let v be the velocity of
the wire, and u the velocity of a charge down the wire; w = v + u is the resultant

velocity of a charge at P. The infinitesimal element of area on the ribbon can be
written as
da = (v × dl)dt
(see inset in Fig. 7.13). Therefore
d
dt= B· (v × dl).
Since w = (v + u) and u is parallel to dl, we can just as well write this as
d
dt= B· (w × dl).
Now, the scalar triple-product can be rewritten:
B· (w × dl)= −(w × B)· dl,
so
d
dt= − (w × B)· dl.
But (w × B) is the magnetic force per unit charge, fmag, so
d
dt= − fmag· dl,
and the integral of fmag is the emf:
d
E= −
dt.
There is a sign ambiguity in the definition of emf (Eq. 7.9): Which way around
the loop are you supposed to integrate? There is a compensatory ambiguity in the
definition of flux (Eq. 7.12): Which is the positive direction for da? In applying
7.1 Electromotive Force 309

FIGURE 7.14
the flux rule, sign consistency is governed (as always) by your right hand: If your
fingers define the positive direction around the loop, then your thumb indicates
the direction of da. Should the emf come out negative, it means the current will
flow in the negative direction around the circuit.
The flux rule is a nifty short-cut for calculating motional emfs. It does not con-
tain any new physics—just the Lorentz force law. But it can lead to error or ambi-
guity if you’re not careful. The flux rule assumes you have a single wire loop—it
can move, rotate, stretch, or distort (continuously), but beware of switches, sliding
contacts, or extended conductors allowing a variety of current paths. A standard
“flux rule paradox” involves the circuit in Figure 7.14. When the switch is thrown
(from a to b) the flux through the circuit doubles, but there’s no motional emf
(no conductor moving through a magnetic field), and the ammeter ( A) records no
current.
Example 7.4. A metal disk of radius a rotates with angular velocity ω about a
vertical axis, through a uniform field B, pointing up. A circuit is made by connect-
ing one end of a resistor to the axle and the other end to a sliding contact, which
touches the outer edge of the disk (Fig. 7.15). Find the current in the resistor.

Example 7.4 (the Faraday disk, or Faraday dynamo) involves a motional
emf that you can’t calculate (at least, not directly) from the flux rule. The flux rule
assumes the current flows along a well-defined path, whereas in this example the
current spreads out over the whole disk. It’s not even clear what the “flux through
the circuit” would mean in this context.
Even more tricky is the case of eddy currents. Take a chunk of aluminum
(say), and shake it around in a nonuniform magnetic field. Currents will be gen-
erated in the material, and you will feel a kind of “viscous drag”—as though you
were pulling the block through molasses (this is the force I called fpull in the dis-
cussion of motional emf). Eddy currents are notoriously difficult to calculate,7 but
easy and dramatic to demonstrate. You may have witnessed the classic experiment
in which an aluminum disk mounted as a pendulum on a horizontal axis swings
down and passes between the poles of a magnet (Fig. 7.16a). When it enters the
field region it suddenly slows way down. To confirm that eddy currents are re-
sponsible, one repeats the demonstration using a disk that has many slots cut in it,
to prevent the flow of large-scale currents (Fig. 7.16b). This time the disk swings
freely, unimpeded by the field.

7.2 ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION
7.2.1 Faraday’s Law
In 1831 Michael Faraday reported on a series of experiments, including three that
(with some violence to history) can be characterized as follows:
Experiment 1. He pulled a loop of wire to the right through a magnetic field
(Fig. 7.21a). A current flowed in the loop.
Experiment 2. He moved the magnet to the left, holding the loop still (Fig. 7.21b).
Again, a current flowed in the loop.
Experiment 3. With both the loop and the magnet at rest (Fig. 7.21c), he changed
the strength of the field (he used an electromagnet, and varied the current
in the coil). Once again, current flowed in the loop.

7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 313
The first experiment, of course, is a straightforward case of motional emf;
according to the flux rule:
d
E= −
dt.
I don’t think it will surprise you to learn that exactly the same emf arises in Ex-
periment 2—all that really matters is the relative motion of the magnet and the
loop. Indeed, in the light of special relativity it has to be so. But Faraday knew
nothing of relativity, and in classical electrodynamics this simple reciprocity is a
remarkable coincidence. For if the loop moves, it’s a magnetic force that sets up
the emf, but if the loop is stationary, the force cannot be magnetic—stationary
charges experience no magnetic forces. In that case, what is responsible? What
sort of field exerts a force on charges at rest? Well, electric fields do, of course,
but in this case there doesn’t seem to be any electric field in sight.
Faraday had an ingenious inspiration:
A changing magnetic field induces an electric field.
It is this induced8 electric field that accounts for the emf in Experiment 2.9 Indeed,
if (as Faraday found empirically) the emf is again equal to the rate of change of
the flux,
d
E= E· dl= −
dt, (7.14)
then E is related to the change in B by the equation
E· dl= −
∂B
∂t· da. (7.15)
This is Faraday’s law, in integral form. We can convert it to differential form by
applying Stokes’ theorem:
∂B
∇ × E= −
∂t. (7.16)
8“Induce” is a subtle and slippery verb. It carries a faint odor of causation (“produce” would make
this explicit) without quite committing itself. There is a sterile ongoing debate in the literature as to
whether a changing magnetic field should be regarded as an independent “source” of electric fields
(along with electric charge)—after all, the magnetic field itself is due to electric currents. It’s like
asking whether the postman is the “source” of my mail. Well, sure—he delivered it to my door. On the
other hand, Grandma wrote the letter. Ultimately, ρ and J are the sources of all electromagnetic fields,
and a changing magnetic field merely delivers electromagnetic news from currents elsewhere. But it
is often convenient to think of a changing magnetic field “producing” an electric field, and it won’t
hurt you as long as you understand that this is the condensed version of a more complicated story. For
a nice discussion, see S. E. Hill, Phys. Teach. 48, 410 (2010).
9You might argue that the magnetic field in Experiment 2 is not really changing—just moving. What
I mean is that if you sit at a fixed location, the field you experience changes as the magnet passes by.
314 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics
Note that Faraday’s law reduces to the old rule E· dl= 0 (or, in differential
form, ∇ × E= 0) in the static case (constant B) as, of course, it should.
In Experiment 3, the magnetic field changes for entirely different reasons, but
according to Faraday’s law an electric field will again be induced, giving rise to
an emf−d/dt. Indeed, one can subsume all three cases (and for that matter any
combination of them) into a kind of universal flux rule:
Whenever (and for whatever reason) the magnetic flux through a
loop changes, an emf
d
E= −
dt (7.17)
will appear in the loop.
Many people call this “Faraday’s law.” Maybe I’m overly fastidious, but I find this
confusing. There are really two totally different mechanisms underlying Eq. 7.17,
and to identify them both as “Faraday’s law” is a little like saying that because
identical twins look alike we ought to call them by the same name. In Faraday’s
first experiment it’s the Lorentz force law at work; the emf is magnetic. But in the
other two it’s an electric field (induced by the changing magnetic field) that does
the job. Viewed in this light, it is quite astonishing that all three processes yield
the same formula for the emf. In fact, it was precisely this “coincidence” that led
Einstein to the special theory of relativity—he sought a deeper understanding of
what is, in classical electrodynamics, a peculiar accident. But that’s a story for
Chapter 12. In the meantime, I shall reserve the term “Faraday’s law” for electric
fields induced by changing magnetic fields, and I do not regard Experiment 1 as
an instance of Faraday’s law.
Example 7.5. A long cylindrical magnet of length L and radius a carries a uni-
form magnetization M parallel to its axis. It passes at constant velocity v through
a circular wire ring of slightly larger diameter (Fig. 7.22). Graph the emf induced
in the ring, as a function of time.

builds up to a maximum of μ0 Mπa2 as the leading end passes through; and it
drops back to zero as the trailing end emerges (Fig. 7.23a). The emf is (minus)
the derivative of with respect to time, so it consists of two spikes, as shown in
Fig. 7.23b.

Keeping track of the signs in Faraday’s law can be a real headache. For in-
stance, in Ex. 7.5 we would like to know which way around the ring the induced
current flows. In principle, the right-hand rule does the job (we called positive
to the left, in Fig. 7.22, so the positive direction for current in the ring is counter-
clockwise, as viewed from the left; since the first spike in Fig. 7.23b is negative,
the first current pulse flows clockwise, and the second counterclockwise). But
there’s a handy rule, called Lenz’s law, whose sole purpose is to help you get the
directions right:10
Nature abhors a change in flux.
The induced current will flow in such a direction that the flux it produces tends
to cancel the change. (As the front end of the magnet in Ex. 7.5 enters the ring,
the flux increases, so the current in the ring must generate a field to the right—it
therefore flows clockwise.) Notice that it is the change in flux, not the flux it-
self, that nature abhors (when the tail end of the magnet exits the ring, the flux
drops, so the induced current flows counterclockwise, in an effort to restore it).
Faraday induction is a kind of “inertial” phenomenon: A conducting loop “likes”
to maintain a constant flux through it; if you try to change the flux, the loop re-
sponds by sending a current around in such a direction as to frustrate your efforts.
(It doesn’t succeed completely; the flux produced by the induced current is typi-
cally only a tiny fraction of the original. All Lenz’s law tells you is the direction of
the flow.)
10Lenz’s law applies to motional emfs, too, but for them it is usually easier to get the direction of the
current from the Lorentz force law.
316 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics
Example 7.6. The “jumping ring” demonstration. If you wind a solenoidal
coil around an iron core (the iron is there to beef up the magnetic field), place
a metal ring on top, and plug it in, the ring will jump several feet in the air
(Fig. 7.24). Why?
B
ring
solenoid
FIGURE 7.24
Solution
Before you turned on the current, the flux through the ring was zero. Afterward a
flux appeared (upward, in the diagram), and the emf generated in the ring led to a
current (in the ring) which, according to Lenz’s law, was in such a direction that
its field tended to cancel this new flux. This means that the current in the loop is
opposite to the current in the solenoid. And opposite currents repel, so the ring
flies off.11
Problem 7.12 A long solenoid, of radius a, is driven by an alternating current, so
that the field inside is sinusoidal: B(t)= B0 cos(ωt)ˆ
z. A circular loop of wire, of
radius a/2 and resistance R, is placed inside the solenoid, and coaxial with it. Find
the current induced in the loop, as a function of time.
Problem 7.13 A square loop of wire, with sides of length a, lies in the first quadrant
of the x y plane, with one corner at the origin. In this region, there is a nonuniform
time-dependent magnetic field B(y,t)= ky3t2ˆ
z (where k is a constant). Find the
emf induced in the loop.
Problem 7.14 As a lecture demonstration a short cylindrical bar magnet is dropped
down a vertical aluminum pipe of slightly larger diameter, about 2 meters long. It
takes several seconds to emerge at the bottom, whereas an otherwise identical piece
of unmagnetized iron makes the trip in a fraction of a second. Explain why the
magnet falls more slowly.12

7.2.2 The Induced Electric Field
Faraday’s law generalizes the electrostatic rule ∇ × E= 0 to the time-dependent
régime. The divergence of E is still given by Gauss’s law (∇· E=
1
ϵ0 ρ). If E is a
pure Faraday field (due exclusively to a changing B, with ρ = 0), then
∂B
∇· E= 0, ∇ × E= −
∂t.
This is mathematically identical to magnetostatics,
∇· B= 0, ∇ × B= μ0J.
Conclusion: Faraday-induced electric fields are determined by−(∂B/∂t) in ex-
actly the same way as magnetostatic fields are determined by μ0J. The analog to

and if symmetry permits, we can use all the tricks associated with Ampère’s law
in integral form ( B· dl= μ0 Ienc), only now it’s Faraday’s law in integral form:

The rate of change of (magnetic) flux through the Amperian loop plays the role
formerly assigned to μ0 Ienc.
Example 7.7. A uniform magnetic field B(t), pointing straight up, fills the
shaded circular region of Fig. 7.25. If B is changing with time, what is the in-
duced electric field?
Solution
E points in the circumferential direction, just like the magnetic field inside a long
straight wire carrying a uniform current density. Draw an Amperian loop of radius

Example 7.8. A line charge λ is glued onto the rim of a wheel of radius b, which
is then suspended horizontally, as shown in Fig. 7.26, so that it is free to rotate (the
spokes are made of some nonconducting material—wood, maybe). In the central
region, out to radius a, there is a uniform magnetic field B0, pointing up. Now
someone turns the field off. What happens?
Solution
The changing magnetic field will induce an electric field, curling around the axis
of the wheel. This electric field exerts a force on the charges at the rim, and the
wheel starts to turn. According to Lenz’s law, it will rotate in such a direction that
its field tends to restore the upward flux. The motion, then, is counterclockwise,
as viewed from above.
Faraday’s law, applied to the loop at radius b, says
d
E· dl= E(2πb)= −

The torque on a segment of length dl is (r × F), or bλE dl. The total torque on

and the angular momentum imparted to the wheel is

It doesn’t matter how quickly or slowly you turn off the field; the resulting angular
velocity of the wheel is the same regardless. (If you find yourself wondering where
the angular momentum came from, you’re getting ahead of the story! Wait for the
next chapter.)
Note that it’s the electric field that did the rotating. To convince you of this,
I deliberately set things up so that the magnetic field is zero at the location of
a2
7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 319
the charge. The experimenter may tell you she never put in any electric field—all
she did was switch off the magnetic field. But when she did that, an electric field
automatically appeared, and it’s this electric field that turned the wheel.
I must warn you, now, of a small fraud that tarnishes many applications of
Faraday’s law: Electromagnetic induction, of course, occurs only when the mag-
netic fields are changing, and yet we would like to use the apparatus of mag-
netostatics (Ampère’s law, the Biot-Savart law, and the rest) to calculate those
magnetic fields. Technically, any result derived in this way is only approximately
correct. But in practice the error is usually negligible, unless the field fluctuates
extremely rapidly, or you are interested in points very far from the source. Even
the case of a wire snipped by a pair of scissors (Prob. 7.18) is static enough for
Ampère’s law to apply. This régime, in which magnetostatic rules can be used to
calculate the magnetic field on the right hand side of Faraday’s law, is called
quasistatic. Generally speaking, it is only when we come to electromagnetic
waves and radiation that we must worry seriously about the breakdown of mag-
netostatics itself.

In the quasistatic approximation, the magnetic field is (μ0 I /2πs), and it circles

14This example is artificial, and not just in the obvious sense of involving infinite wires, but in a more
subtle respect. It assumes that the current is the same (at any given instant) all the way down the
line. This is a safe assumption for the short wires in typical electric circuits, but not for long wires
(transmission lines), unless you supply a distributed and synchronized driving mechanism. But never
mind—the problem doesn’t inquire how you would produce such a current; it only asks what fields
would result if you did. Variations on this problem are discussed by M. A. Heald, Am. J. Phys. 54,
1142 (1986).

where K is a constant (that is to say, it is independent of s—it might still be a

I (t)—we’ll see some examples in Chapter 10.
Equation 7.20 has the peculiar implication that E blows up as s goes to infin-
ity. That can’t be true . . . What’s gone wrong? Answer: We have overstepped the
limits of the quasistatic approximation. As we shall see in Chapter 9, electromag-
netic “news” travels at the speed of light, and at large distances B depends not
on the current now, but on the current as it was at some earlier time (indeed, a
whole range of earlier times, since different points on the wire are different dis-
tances away). If τ is the time it takes I to change substantially, then the quasistatic
approximation should hold only for
s ≪ cτ, (7.21)
and hence Eq. 7.20 simply does not apply, at extremely large s.
Problem 7.15 A long solenoid with radius a and n turns per unit length carries a

15This is not at all the way electric fields actually behave in coaxial cables, for reasons suggested in
the previous footnote. See Sect. 9.5.3, or J. G. Cherveniak, Am. J. Phys., 54, 946 (1986), for a more
realistic treatment.
7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 321
(a) If the current in the solenoid is increasing at a constant rate (d I /dt= k), what
current flows in the loop, and which way (left or right) does it pass through the
resistor?
(b) If the current I in the solenoid is constant but the solenoid is pulled out of the
loop (toward the left, to a place far from the loop), what total charge passes
through the resistor?
Problem 7.18 A square loop, side a, resistance R, lies a distance s from an infinite
straight wire that carries current I (Fig. 7.29). Now someone cuts the wire, so I
drops to zero. In what direction does the induced current in the square loop flow,
and what total charge passes a given point in the loop during the time this current
flows? If you don’t like the scissors model, turn the current down gradually:

(1− αt)I, for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/α,
0, for t > 1/α.

less than a, find the electric field at a point z above the center of the toroid. [Hint:

B1 =

reveals one significant fact about this field: It is proportional to the current I1.
Therefore, so too is the flux through loop 2:
2 = B1· da2.
Thus
2 = M21 I1, (7.22)
where M21 is the constant of proportionality; it is known as the mutual induc-
tance of the two loops.
There is a cute formula for the mutual inductance, which you can derive by
expressing the flux in terms of the vector potential, and invoking Stokes’ theorem:
2 = B1· da2 = (∇ × A1)· da2 = A1· dl2.
Now, according to Eq. 5.66,

7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 323
This is the Neumann formula; it involves a double line integral—one integration
around loop 1, the other around loop 2 (Fig. 7.31). It’s not very useful for practical
calculations, but it does reveal two important things about mutual inductance:
1. M21 is a purely geometrical quantity, having to do with the sizes, shapes,
and relative positions of the two loops.
2. The integral in Eq. 7.23 is unchanged if we switch the roles of loops 1 and
2; it follows that
M21 = M12. (7.24)
This is an astonishing conclusion: Whatever the shapes and positions of the
loops, the flux through 2 when we run a current I around 1 is identical to
the flux through 1 when we send the same current I around 2. We may as
well drop the subscripts and call them both M.
Example 7.10. A short solenoid (length l and radius a, with n1 turns per unit
length) lies on the axis of a very long solenoid (radius b, n2 turns per unit length)
as shown in Fig. 7.32. Current I flows in the short solenoid. What is the flux
through the long solenoid?
a
b
l
FIGURE 7.32
Solution
Since the inner solenoid is short, it has a very complicated field; moreover, it puts
a different flux through each turn of the outer solenoid. It would be a miserable
task to compute the total flux this way. However, if we exploit the equality of the
mutual inductances, the problem becomes very easy. Just look at the reverse situ-
ation: run the current I through the outer solenoid, and calculate the flux through
the inner one. The field inside the long solenoid is constant:
B= μ0n2 I
(Eq. 5.59), so the flux through a single loop of the short solenoid is
Bπa2
= μ0n2 I πa2
.
There are n1l turns in all, so the total flux through the inner solenoid is
= μ0πa2n1n2l I.
324 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics
This is also the flux a current I in the short solenoid would put through the long
one, which is what we set out to find. Incidentally, the mutual inductance, in this
case, is
M= μ0πa2n1n2l.
Suppose, now, that you vary the current in loop 1. The flux through loop 2 will
vary accordingly, and Faraday’s law says this changing flux will induce an emf in
loop 2:
E2 = −
d 2
d I1
dt= −M
dt. (7.25)
(In quoting Eq. 7.22—which was based on the Biot-Savart law—I am tacitly
assuming that the currents change slowly enough for the system to be consid-
ered quasistatic.) What a remarkable thing: Every time you change the current
in loop 1, an induced current flows in loop 2—even though there are no wires
connecting them!
Come to think of it, a changing current not only induces an emf in any nearby
loops, it also induces an emf in the source loop itself (Fig 7.33). Once again, the
field (and therefore also the flux) is proportional to the current:
= L I. (7.26)
The constant of proportionality L is called the self inductance (or simply the
inductance) of the loop. As with M, it depends on the geometry (size and shape)
of the loop. If the current changes, the emf induced in the loop is

Inductance (like capacitance) is an intrinsically positive quantity. Lenz’s law,
which is enforced by the minus sign in Eq. 7.27, dictates that the emf is in such
a direction as to oppose any change in current. For this reason, it is called a
back emf. Whenever you try to alter the current in a wire, you must fight against
this back emf. Inductance plays somewhat the same role in electric circuits that
mass plays in mechanical systems: The greater L is, the harder it is to change
the current, just as the larger the mass, the harder it is to change an object’s
velocity.
Example 7.12. Suppose a current I is flowing around a loop, when someone
suddenly cuts the wire. The current drops “instantaneously” to zero. This gen-
erates a whopping back emf, for although I may be small, d I /dt is enormous.
(That’s why you sometimes draw a spark when you unplug an iron or toaster—
electromagnetic induction is desperately trying to keep the current going, even if
it has to jump the gap in the circuit.)
Nothing so dramatic occurs when you plug in a toaster or iron. In this case in-
duction opposes the sudden increase in current, prescribing instead a smooth and
326 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics

This function is plotted in Fig. 7.36. Had there been no inductance in the circuit,
the current would have jumped immediately to E0/R. In practice, every circuit
has some self-inductance, and the current approaches E0/R asymptotically. The
quantity τ ≡ L/R is the time constant; it tells you how long the current takes to
reach a substantial fraction (roughly two-thirds) of its final value.

of a large loop (radius b), as shown in Fig. 7.37. The planes of the two loops are
parallel, and perpendicular to the common axis.

inductance calculations. To get a definite answer, assume the wire has a tiny radius ϵ,
and ignore any flux through the wire itself.
Problem 7.26 An alternating current I (t)= I0 cos(ωt) (amplitude 0.5 A, frequency

7.2.4 Energy in Magnetic Fields
It takes a certain amount of energy to start a current flowing in a circuit. I’m not
talking about the energy delivered to the resistors and converted into heat—that
is irretrievably lost, as far as the circuit is concerned, and can be large or small,
depending on how long you let the current run. What I am concerned with, rather,
is the work you must do against the back emf to get the current going. This is
a fixed amount, and it is recoverable: you get it back when the current is turned
off. In the meantime, it represents energy latent in the circuit; as we’ll see in a
moment, it can be regarded as energy stored in the magnetic field.
The work done on a unit charge, against the back emf, in one trip around the
circuit is−E (the minus sign records the fact that this is the work done by you
against the emf, not the work done by the emf). The amount of charge per unit
time passing down the wire is I . So the total work done per unit time is
d W
dt= −E I= L I
d I
dt.
If we start with zero current and build it up to a final value I , the work done
(integrating the last equation over time) is
W=
1
L I 2
. (7.30)
2
It does not depend on how long we take to crank up the current, only on the
geometry of the loop (in the form of L) and the final current I .
There is a nicer way to write W , which has the advantage that it is readily
generalized to surface and volume currents. Remember that the flux through
the loop is equal to L I (Eq. 7.26). On the other hand,
= B· da = (∇ × A)· da = A· dl,
where the line integral is around the perimeter of the loop. Thus
L I= A· dl,
7.2 Electromagnetic Induction 329
and therefore
1
W=
2
I A· dl=
1
2 (A· I)dl. (7.31)
In this form, the generalization to volume currents is obvious:
1
W=
2 V
(A· J)dτ. (7.32)
But we can do even better, and express W entirely in terms of the magnetic
field: Ampère’s law, ∇ × B= μ0J, lets us eliminate J:
1
W=
2μ0
A· (∇ × B)dτ. (7.33)
Integration by parts transfers the derivative from B to A; specifically, product rule
6 states that
∇· (A × B)= B· (∇ × A)− A· (∇ × B),
so
A· (∇ × B)= B· B− ∇· (A × B).
Consequently,
W=
1
2μ0
B2 dτ− ∇· (A × B)dτ
=
1
2μ0 V
B2 dτ−
S
(A × B)· da , (7.34)
where S is the surface bounding the volume V.
Now, the integration in Eq. 7.32 is to be taken over the entire volume occupied
by the current. But any region larger than this will do just as well, for J is zero
out there anyway. In Eq. 7.34, the larger the region we pick the greater is the
contribution from the volume integral, and therefore the smaller is that of the
surface integral (this makes sense: as the surface gets farther from the current,
both A and B decrease). In particular, if we agree to integrate over all space, then
the surface integral goes to zero, and we are left with
1
2μ0 all space
B2 dτ. (7.35)
In view of this result, we say the energy is “stored in the magnetic field,” in
the amount (B2/2μ0) per unit volume. This is a nice way to think of it, though
someone looking at Eq. 7.32 might prefer to say that the energy is stored in the
current distribution, in the amount 1
2 (A· J) per unit volume. The distinction is
one of bookkeeping; the important quantity is the total energy W , and we need
not worry about where (if anywhere) the energy is “located.”
W=
330 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics
You might find it strange that it takes energy to set up a magnetic field—after
all, magnetic fields themselves do no work. The point is that producing a magnetic
field, where previously there was none, requires changing the field, and a chang-
ing B-field, according to Faraday, induces an electric field. The latter, of course,
can do work. In the beginning, there is no E, and at the end there is no E; but in
between, while B is building up, there is an E, and it is against this that the work
is done. (You see why I could not calculate the energy stored in a magnetostatic
field back in Chapter 5.) In the light of this, it is extraordinary how similar the
magnetic energy formulas are to their electrostatic counterparts:18

This method of calculating self-inductance is especially useful when the current
is not confined to a single path, but spreads over some surface or volume, so that
different parts of the current enclose different amounts of flux. In such cases, it
can be very tricky to get the inductance directly from Eq. 7.26, and it is best to let
Eq. 7.30 define L.

7.3 MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS
7.3.1 Electrodynamics Before Maxwell
So far, we have encountered the following laws, specifying the divergence and
curl of electric and magnetic fields:
(i) ∇· E=
ρ (Gauss’s law),
ϵ0
(ii) ∇· B= 0 (no name),
∂B
(iii) ∇ × E= −
∂t (Faraday’s law),
(iv) ∇ × B= μ0J (Ampère’s law).
7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 333
These equations represent the state of electromagnetic theory in the mid-nineteenth
century, when Maxwell began his work. They were not written in so compact a
form, in those days, but their physical content was familiar. Now, it happens that
there is a fatal inconsistency in these formulas. It has to do with the old rule that
divergence of curl is always zero. If you apply the divergence to number (iii),
everything works out:
∇· (∇ × E)= ∇· −
∂B
∂t
= −
∂
∂t (∇· B).
The left side is zero because divergence of curl is zero; the right side is zero by
virtue of equation (ii). But when you do the same thing to number (iv), you get
into trouble:
∇· (∇ × B)= μ0(∇· J); (7.36)
the left side must be zero, but the right side, in general, is not. For steady currents,
the divergence of J is zero, but when we go beyond magnetostatics Ampère’s law
cannot be right.
There’s another way to see that Ampère’s law is bound to fail for nonsteady
currents. Suppose we’re in the process of charging up a capacitor (Fig. 7.43). In
integral form, Ampère’s law reads
B· dl= μ0 Ienc.
I want to apply it to the Amperian loop shown in the diagram. How do I deter-
mine Ienc? Well, it’s the total current passing through the loop, or, more precisely,
the current piercing a surface that has the loop for its boundary. In this case, the
simplest surface lies in the plane of the loop—the wire punctures this surface, so
Ienc = I . Fine—but what if I draw instead the balloon-shaped surface in Fig. 7.43?
No current passes through this surface, and I conclude that Ienc = 0! We never
had this problem in magnetostatics because the conflict arises only when charge

334 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics
is piling up somewhere (in this case, on the capacitor plates). But for nonsteady
currents (such as this one) “the current enclosed by the loop” is an ill-defined
notion; it depends entirely on what surface you use. (If this seems pedantic to
you—“obviously one should use the plane surface”—remember that the Ampe-
rian loop could be some contorted shape that doesn’t even lie in a plane.)
Of course, we had no right to expect Ampère’s law to hold outside of magne-
tostatics; after all, we derived it from the Biot-Savart law. However, in Maxwell’s
time there was no experimental reason to doubt that Ampère’s law was of wider
validity. The flaw was a purely theoretical one, and Maxwell fixed it by purely
theoretical arguments.
How Maxwell Fixed Ampère’s Law
The problem is on the right side of Eq. 7.36, which should be zero, but isn’t.
Applying the continuity equation (5.29) and Gauss’s law, the offending term can
be rewritten:
∂
∇· J= −
= −
∂t
∂t (ϵ0∇· E)= −∇· ϵ0
∂E
∂t.
If we were to combine ϵ0(∂E/∂t) with J, in Ampère’s law, it would be just right
to kill off the extra divergence:
7.3.2 ∂ρ
∂E
∇ × B= μ0J + μ0ϵ0
∂t. (7.37)
(Maxwell himself had other reasons for wanting to add this quantity to Ampère’s
law. To him, the rescue of the continuity equation was a happy dividend rather than
a primary motive. But today we recognize this argument as a far more compelling
one than Maxwell’s, which was based on a now-discredited model of the ether.)20
Such a modification changes nothing, as far as magnetostatics is concerned:
when E is constant, we still have ∇ × B= μ0J. In fact, Maxwell’s term is hard
to detect in ordinary electromagnetic experiments, where it must compete for at-
tention with J—that’s why Faraday and the others never discovered it in the lab-
oratory. However, it plays a crucial role in the propagation of electromagnetic
waves, as we’ll see in Chapter 9.
Apart from curing the defect in Ampère’s law, Maxwell’s term has a cer-
tain aesthetic appeal: Just as a changing magnetic field induces an electric field
(Faraday’s law), so21
A changing electric field induces a magnetic field.
20For the history of this subject, see A. M. Bork, Am. J. Phys. 31, 854 (1963).
21See footnote 8 (page 313) for commentary on the word “induce.” The same issue arises here: Should
a changing electric field be regarded as an independent source of magnetic field (along with current)?
In a proximate sense it does function as a source, but since the electric field itself was produced by
charges and currents, they alone are the “ultimate” sources of E and B. See S. E. Hill, Phys. Teach.
49, 343 (2011); for a contrary view, see C. Savage, Phys. Teach. 50, 226 (2012).
7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 335
Of course, theoretical convenience and aesthetic consistency are only suggestive—
there might, after all, be other ways to doctor up Ampère’s law. The real confir-
mation of Maxwell’s theory came in 1888 with Hertz’s experiments on electro-
magnetic waves.
Maxwell called his extra term the displacement current:
∂E
Jd ≡ ϵ0
∂t. (7.38)
(It’s a misleading name; ϵ0(∂E/∂t) has nothing to do with current, except that it
adds to J in Ampère’s law.) Let’s see now how displacement current resolves the
paradox of the charging capacitor (Fig. 7.43). If the capacitor plates are very close
together (I didn’t draw them that way, but the calculation is simpler if you assume
this), then the electric field between them is

where Q is the charge on the plate and A is its area. Thus, between the plates

ϵ0 A
Now, Eq. 7.37 reads, in integral form,
B· dl= μ0 Ienc + μ0ϵ0
∂E
∂t· da. (7.39)
If we choose the flat surface, then E= 0 and Ienc = I . If, on the other hand, we
use the balloon-shaped surface, then Ienc = 0, but (∂E/∂t)· da = I /ϵ0. So we
get the same answer for either surface, though in the first case it comes from the
conduction current, and in the second from the displacement current.
Example 7.14. Imagine two concentric metal spherical shells (Fig. 7.44).
The inner one (radius a) carries a charge Q(t), and the outer one (radius b) an
opposite charge−Q(t). The space between them is filled with Ohmic material of
conductivity σ, so a radial current flows:

This configuration is spherically symmetrical, so the magnetic field has to be zero
(the only direction it could possibly point is radial, and ∇· B= 0 ⇒ B· da =
B(4πr 2)= 0, so B= 0). What? I thought currents produce magnetic fields! Isn’t
that what Biot-Savart and Ampère taught us? How can there be a J with no
accompanying B?

tributed over its cross section. A narrow gap in the wire, of width w ≪ a, forms

connect to the centers of the plates (Fig. 7.46a). Again, the current I is constant,
the radius of the capacitor is a, and the separation of the plates is w ≪ a. Assume
that the current flows out over the plates in such a way that the surface charge is
uniform, at any given time, and is zero at t = 0.

problem is designed to indicate why Faraday never discovered displacement
currents, and why it is ordinarily safe to ignore them unless the frequency is
extremely high.]

have you detected the effects of displacement current (as (b) would suggest), or merely confirmed the
effects of ordinary currents (as (c) implies)? See D. F. Bartlett, Am. J. Phys. 58, 1168 (1990).
338 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics
Together with the force law,
F= q(E + v × B), (7.41)
they summarize the entire theoretical content of classical electrodynamics23 (save
for some special properties of matter, which we encountered in Chapters 4 and 6).
Even the continuity equation,
∂ρ
∇· J= −
, (7.42)
∂t
which is the mathematical expression of conservation of charge, can be derived
from Maxwell’s equations by applying the divergence to number (iv).
I have written Maxwell’s equations in the traditional way, which emphasizes
that they specify the divergence and curl of E and B. In this form, they reinforce
the notion that electric fields can be produced either by charges (ρ) or by changing
magnetic fields (∂B/∂t), and magnetic fields can be produced either by currents
(J) or by changing electric fields (∂E/∂t). Actually, this is misleading, because
∂B/∂t and ∂E/∂t are themselves due to charges and currents. I think it is logically
preferable to write

with the fields (E and B) on the left and the sources (ρ and J) on the right. This
notation emphasizes that all electromagnetic fields are ultimately attributable to
charges and currents. Maxwell’s equations tell you how charges produce fields;
reciprocally, the force law tells you how fields affect charges.

gives rise to these fields.
7.3.4 Magnetic Charge
There is a pleasing symmetry to Maxwell’s equations; it is particularly striking in
free space, where ρ and J vanish:

23Like any differential equations, Maxwell’s must be supplemented by suitable boundary conditions.
Because these are typically “obvious” from the context (e.g. E and B go to zero at large distances from
a localized charge distribution), it is easy to forget that they play an essential role.
,
∂E
7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 339
If you replace E by B and B by−μ0ϵ0E, the first pair of equations turns into the
second, and vice versa. This symmetry24 between E and B is spoiled, though, by
the charge term in Gauss’s law and the current term in Ampère’s law. You can’t
help wondering why the corresponding quantities are “missing” from ∇· B= 0
and ∇ × E= −∂B/∂t. What if we had
1
∂B
(i) ∇· E=
ρe, (iii) ∇ × E= −μ0Jm−

(ii) ∇· B= μ0ρm , (iv) ∇ × B= μ0Je + μ0ϵ0

⎫ ⎪ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎪ ⎭
(7.44)
Then ρm would represent the density of magnetic “charge,” and ρe the density of
electric charge; Jm would be the current of magnetic charge, and Je the current of
electric charge. Both charges would be conserved:
∇· Jm = −
∂ρm
∂t
, and ∇· Je = −
∂ρe
∂t. (7.45)
The former follows by application of the divergence to (iii), the latter by taking
the divergence of (iv).
In a sense, Maxwell’s equations beg for magnetic charge to exist—it would fit
in so nicely. And yet, in spite of a diligent search, no one has ever found any.25
As far as we know, ρm is zero everywhere, and so is Jm ; B is not on equal foot-
ing with E: there exist stationary sources for E (electric charges) but none for B.
(This is reflected in the fact that magnetic multipole expansions have no monopole
term, and magnetic dipoles consist of current loops, not separated north and south
“poles.”) Apparently God just didn’t make any magnetic charge. (In quantum elec-
trodynamics, by the way, it’s a more than merely aesthetic shame that magnetic
charge does not seem to exist: Dirac showed that the existence of magnetic charge
would explain why electric charge is quantized. See Prob. 8.19.)

7.3.5 Maxwell’s Equations in Matter
Maxwell’s equations in the form 7.40 are complete and correct as they stand.
However, when you are working with materials that are subject to electric and
magnetic polarization there is a more convenient way to write them. For inside
polarized matter there will be accumulations of “bound” charge and current, over
which you exert no direct control. It would be nice to reformulate Maxwell’s
equations so as to make explicit reference only to the “free” charges and currents.
We have already learned, from the static case, that an electric polarization P
produces a bound charge density
ρb = −∇· P (7.47)
(Eq. 4.12). Likewise, a magnetic polarization (or “magnetization”) M results in a
bound current
Jb = ∇ × M (7.48)
(Eq. 6.13). There’s just one new feature to consider in the nonstatic case: Any
change in the electric polarization involves a flow of (bound) charge (call it Jp ),
which must be included in the total current. For suppose we examine a tiny chunk
of polarized material (Fig. 7.47). The polarization introduces a charge density
σb = P at one end and−σb at the other (Eq. 4.11). If P now increases a bit, the
charge on each end increases accordingly, giving a net current
∂σb
∂ P
d I=
da⊥ =
da⊥.
The current density, therefore, is
∂t
∂t
∂P
Jp =
∂t. (7.49)
This polarization current has nothing to do with the bound current Jb. The
latter is associated with magnetization of the material and involves the spin and
orbital motion of electrons; Jp , by contrast, is the result of the linear motion of
charge when the electric polarization changes. If P points to the right, and is
increasing, then each plus charge moves a bit to the right and each minus charge
to the left; the cumulative effect is the polarization current Jp . We ought to check
that Eq. 7.49 is consistent with the continuity equation:

FIGURE 7.47
7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 341
Yes: The continuity equation is satisfied; in fact, Jp is essential to ensure the
conservation of bound charge. (Incidentally, a changing magnetization does not
lead to any analogous accumulation of charge or current. The bound current
Jb = ∇ × M varies in response to changes in M, to be sure, but that’s about it.)
In view of all this, the total charge density can be separated into two parts:
ρ = ρf + ρb = ρf− ∇· P, (7.50)
and the current density into three parts:
J= J f + Jb + Jp = J f + ∇ × M +
∂P
∂t. (7.51)
Gauss’s law can now be written as
1
∇· E=
(ρf− ∇· P),
ϵ0
or
∇· D= ρf, (7.52)
where, as in the static case,
D ≡ ϵ0E + P. (7.53)
Meanwhile, Ampère’s law (with Maxwell’s term) becomes
∇ × B= μ0 J f + ∇ × M +
∂P
∂t
∂E
+ μ0ϵ0
,
∂t
or
∂D
∇ × H= J f +
, (7.54)
∂t
where, as before,
1
H ≡
B− M. (7.55)
μ0
Faraday’s law and ∇· B= 0 are not affected by our separation of charge and
current into free and bound parts, since they do not involve ρ or J.
In terms of free charges and currents, then, Maxwell’s equations read
∂B
(i) ∇· D= ρf , ,
(ii) ∇· B= 0, (iii) ∇ × E= −
∂t
(iv) ∇ × H= J f +
(7.56)
∂D
∂t.
Some people regard these as the “true” Maxwell’s equations, but please under-
stand that they are in no way more “general” than Eq. 7.40; they simply reflect a
convenient division of charge and current into free and nonfree parts. And they
342 Chapter 7 Electrodynamics
have the disadvantage of hybrid notation, since they contain both E and D, both
B and H. They must be supplemented, therefore, by appropriate constitutive
relations, giving D and H in terms of E and B. These depend on the nature of
the material; for linear media
P= ϵ0χeE, and M= χm H, (7.57)
so
1
D= ϵE, and H=
B, (7.58)

where ϵ ≡ ϵ0(1 + χe) and μ ≡ μ0(1 + χm ). Incidentally, you’ll remember that
D is called the electric “displacement”; that’s why the second term in the
Ampère/Maxwell equation (iv) came to be called the displacement current.
In this context,
Jd ≡
∂D
∂t. (7.59)
Problem 7.40 Sea water at frequency ν = 4 × 108 Hz has permittivity ϵ = 81ϵ0,
permeability μ = μ0, and resistivity ρ = 0.23· m. What is the ratio of conduc-
tion current to displacement current? [Hint: Consider a parallel-plate capacitor im-
mersed in sea water and driven by a voltage V0 cos (2πνt).]
7.3.6 Boundary Conditions
In general, the fields E, B, D, and H will be discontinuous at a boundary between
two different media, or at a surface that carries a charge density σ or a current den-
sity K. The explicit form of these discontinuities can be deduced from Maxwell’s
equations (7.56), in their integral form

Applying (i) to a tiny, wafer-thin Gaussian pillbox extending just slightly into
the material on either side of the boundary (Fig. 7.48), we obtain:
D1· a− D2· a = σf a.
(The positive direction for a is from 2 toward 1. The edge of the wafer con-
tributes nothing in the limit as the thickness goes to zero; nor does any volume

discontinuous in the amount

Identical reasoning, applied to equation (ii), yields
B⊥

E1· l− E2· l= −

B· da.
But in the limit as the width of the loop goes to zero, the flux vanishes. (I have
already dropped the contribution of the two ends to E· dl, on the same grounds.)
Therefore,
E∥
1− E∥
2 = 0. (7.62)
That is, the components of E parallel to the interface are continuous across the
boundary. By the same token, (iv) implies
H1· l− H2· l= I fenc ,
where I fenc is the free current passing through the Amperian loop. No volume
current density will contribute (in the limit of infinitesimal width), but a surface
current can. In fact, ifˆ
n is a unit vector perpendicular to the interface (pointing
from 2 toward 1), so that (ˆ
n × l) is normal to the Amperian loop (Fig. 7.49), then
I fenc

So the parallel components of H are discontinuous by an amount proportional to
the free surface current density.
Equations 7.60-63 are the general boundary conditions for electrodynamics. In
the case of linear media, they can be expressed in terms of E and B alone:

where ρ is the resistivity and a is the radius (see Exs. 7.1 and 7.3). Question: What is

This does not suffice to determine the answer—we still need to specify boundary
conditions at the two ends (though for a long wire it shouldn’t matter much). In the
literature, it is customary to sweep this ambiguity under the rug by simply stipulat-
ing that V (s, z) is proportional to z: V (s, z)= z f (s). On this assumption:
(a) Determine f (s).
(b) Find E(s, z).
(c) Calculate the surface charge density σ(z) on the wire.
[Answer: V= (−I zρ/πa2)[ln(s/b)/ln(a/b)] This is a peculiar result, since Es and
σ(z) are not independent of z—as one would certainly expect for a truly infinite
wire.]
Problem 7.44 In a perfect conductor, the conductivity is infinite, so E= 0
(Eq. 7.3), and any net charge resides on the surface (just as it does for an imperfect
conductor, in electrostatics).
(a) Show that the magnetic field is constant (∂B/∂t = 0), inside a perfect
conductor.
(b) Show that the magnetic flux through a perfectly conducting loop is constant.
A superconductor is a perfect conductor with the additional property that
the (constant) B inside is in fact zero. (This “flux exclusion” is known as the
Meissner effect.
30)
29This is a famous problem, first analyzed by Sommerfeld, and is known in its most recent incarna-
tion as Merzbacher’s puzzle. A. Sommerfeld, Electrodynamics, p. 125 (New York: Academic Press,
1952); E. Merzbacher, Am. J. Phys. 48, 178 (1980); further references in R. N. Varnay and L. H. Fisher,
Am. J. Phys. 52, 1097 (1984).
30The Meissner effect is sometimes referred to as “perfect diamagnetism,” in the sense that the field
inside is not merely reduced, but canceled entirely. However, the surface currents responsible for this
are free, not bound, so the actual mechanism is quite different.
7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 347
(c) Show that the current in a superconductor is confined to the surface.
(d) Superconductivity is lost above a certain critical temperature (Tc ), which varies
from one material to another. Suppose you had a sphere (radius a) above its
critical temperature, and you held it in a uniform magnetic field B0ˆ
z while cool-
ing it below Tc . Find the induced surface current density K, as a function of the
polar angle θ.
Problem 7.45 A familiar demonstration of superconductivity (Prob. 7.44) is the lev-
itation of a magnet over a piece of superconducting material. This phenomenon can
be analyzed using the method of images.31 Treat the magnet as a perfect dipole m,
a height z above the origin (and constrained to point in the z direction), and pretend
that the superconductor occupies the entire half-space below the x y plane. Because
of the Meissner effect, B= 0 for z ≤ 0, and since B is divergenceless, the normal
(z) component is continuous, so Bz = 0 just above the surface. This boundary con-
dition is met by the image configuration in which an identical dipole is placed at
−z, as a stand-in for the superconductor; the two arrangements therefore produce
the same magnetic field in the region z > 0.
(a) Which way should the image dipole point (+z or−z)?
(b) Find the force on the magnet due to the induced currents in the superconductor
(which is to say, the force due to the image dipole). Set it equal to Mg (where
M is the mass of the magnet) to determine the height h at which the magnet will
“float.” [Hint: Refer to Prob. 6.3.]
(c) The induced current on the surface of the superconductor (the x y plane) can
be determined from the boundary condition on the tangential component of B
(Eq. 5.76): B= μ0(K ×ˆ

a magnet such that the average field over the area of the orbit is twice the field at

the electron velocity remains well below the speed of light, so that nonrelativis-

Problem 7.58 A transformer (Prob. 7.57) takes an input AC voltage of amplitude
V1, and delivers an output voltage of amplitude V2, which is determined by the turns
ratio (V2/V1 = N2/N1). If N2 > N1, the output voltage is greater than the input
voltage. Why doesn’t this violate conservation of energy? Answer: Power is the
product of voltage and current; if the voltage goes up, the current must come down.

model.

dλ/dt= −d I /dz. If we stipulate that λ(0)= 0 and I (0)= 0, show that
λ(t)= kt, I (z)= −kz, where k is a constant.
(b) Assume for a moment that the process is quasistatic, so the fields are given
by Eqs. 2.9 and 5.38. Show that these are in fact the exact fields, by confirm-
ing that all four of Maxwell’s equations are satisfied. (First do it in differential
form, for the region s > 0, then in integral form for the appropriate Gaussian
cylinder/Amperian loop straddling the axis.)
Problem 7.60 Suppose J(r) is constant in time but ρ(r,t) is not—conditions that
might prevail, for instance, during the charging of a capacitor.
(a) Show that the charge density at any particular point is a linear function of time:
ρ(r, t)= ρ(r,0) + ˙ ρ(r, 0)t,
where˙ ρ(r, 0) is the time derivative of ρ at t = 0. [Hint: Use the continuity
equation.]
This is not an electrostatic or magnetostatic configuration;34 nevertheless, rather
surprisingly, both Coulomb’s law (Eq. 2.8) and the Biot-Savart law (Eq. 5.42)
hold, as you can confirm by showing that they satisfy Maxwell’s equations. In
particular:
34Some authors would regard this as magnetostatic, since B is independent of t. For them, the Biot-
Savart law is a general rule of magnetostatics, but ∇· J= 0 and ∇ × B= μ0J apply only under the
additional assumption that ρ is constant. In such a formulation, Maxwell’s displacement term can
(in this very special case) be derived from the Biot-Savart law, by the method of part (b). See D. F.

obeys Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s displacement current term.
Problem 7.61 The magnetic field of an infinite straight wire carrying a steady cur-
rent I can be obtained from the displacement current term in the Ampère/Maxwell
law, as follows: Picture the current as consisting of a uniform line charge λ mov-
ing along the z axis at speed v (so that I= λv), with a tiny gap of length ϵ, which
reaches the origin at time t = 0. In the next instant (up to t = ϵ/v) there is no real
current passing through a circular Amperian loop in the x y plane, but there is a
displacement current, due to the “missing” charge in the gap.
(a) Use Coulomb’s law to calculate the z component of the electric field, for points
in the x y plane a distance s from the origin, due to a segment of wire with
uniform density−λ extending from z1 = vt− ϵ to z2 = vt.
(b) Determine the flux of this electric field through a circle of radius a in the x y
plane.
(c) Find the displacement current through this circle. Show that Id is equal to I , in
the limit as the gap width (ϵ) goes to zero.35
Problem 7.62 A certain transmission line is constructed from two thin metal “rib-
bons,” of width w, a very small distance h ≪ w apart. The current travels down
one strip and back along the other. In each case, it spreads out uniformly over the
surface of the ribbon.
(a) Find the capacitance per unit length, C.
(b) Find the inductance per unit length, L.
(c) What is the product LC, numerically? [L and C will, of course, vary from one
kind of transmission line to another, but their product is a universal constant—
check, for example, the cable in Ex. 7.13—provided the space between the con-
ductors is a vacuum. In the theory of transmission lines, this product is related
to the speed with which a pulse propagates down the line: v = 1/√LC.]
(d) If the strips are insulated from one another by a nonconducting material of per-
mittivity ϵ and permeability μ, what then is the product LC? What is the propa-
gation speed? [Hint: see Ex. 4.6; by what factor does L change when an inductor
is immersed in linear material of permeability μ?]
Problem 7.63 Prove Alfven’s theorem: In a perfectly conducting fluid (say, a gas
of free electrons), the magnetic flux through any closed loop moving with the fluid
is constant in time. (The magnetic field lines are, as it were, “frozen” into the fluid.)

Intermission
All of our cards are now on the table, and in a sense my job is done. In the
first seven chapters we assembled electrodynamics piece by piece, and now, with
Maxwell’s equations in their final form, the theory is complete. There are no
more laws to be learned, no further generalizations to be considered, and (with
perhaps one exception) no lurking inconsistencies to be resolved. If yours is a
one-semester course, this would be a reasonable place to stop.
But in another sense we have just arrived at the starting point. We are at last
in possession of a full deck—it’s time to deal. This is the fun part, in which one
comes to appreciate the extraordinary power and richness of electrodynamics. In
a full-year course there should be plenty of time to cover the remaining chapters,
and perhaps to supplement them with a unit on plasma physics, say, or AC circuit
theory, or even a little general relativity. But if you have room for only one topic,
I’d recommend Chapter 9, on Electromagnetic Waves (you’ll probably want to
skim Chapter 8 as preparation). This is the segue to Optics, and is historically the
most important application of Maxwell’s theory.

8 Conservation Laws
8.1 CHARGE AND ENERGY
8.1.1 The Continuity Equation
In this chapter we study conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momen-
tum, in electrodynamics. But I want to begin by reviewing the conservation of
charge, because it is the paradigm for all conservation laws. What precisely does
conservation of charge tell us? That the total charge in the universe is constant?
Well, sure—that’s global conservation of charge. But local conservation of charge
is a much stronger statement: If the charge in some region changes, then exactly
that amount of charge must have passed in or out through the surface. The tiger
can’t simply rematerialize outside the cage; if it got from inside to outside it must
have slipped through a hole in the fence.
Formally, the charge in a volume V is
Q(t)=
V
ρ(r,t)dτ, (8.1)
and the current flowing out through the boundary S isvation of charge says
 S J· da, so local conser-
d Q
dt= −
S
J· da. (8.2)
Using Eq. 8.1 to rewrite the left side, and invoking the divergence theorem on the
right, we have
V
∂t
dτ = −
V
∇· J dτ, (8.3)
and since this is true for any volume, it follows that
∂ρ
∂ρ
= −∇· J. (8.4)
∂t
This is the continuity equation—the precise mathematical statement of lo-
cal conservation of charge. It can be derived from Maxwell’s equations—
conservation of charge is not an independent assumption; it is built into the laws
356
8.1 Charge and Energy 357
of electrodynamics. It serves as a constraint on the sources (ρ and J). They can’t
be just any old functions—they have to respect conservation of charge.1
The purpose of this chapter is to develop the corresponding equations for local
conservation of energy and momentum. In the process (and perhaps more impor-
tant) we will learn how to express the energy density and the momentum density
(the analogs to ρ), as well as the energy “current” and the momentum “current”
(analogous to J).
8.1.2 Poynting’s Theorem
In Chapter 2, we found that the work necessary to assemble a static charge distri-
bution (against the Coulomb repulsion of like charges) is (Eq. 2.45)
ϵ0
We =

E2 dτ,
where E is the resulting electric field. Likewise, the work required to get currents
going (against the back emf) is (Eq. 7.35)
1

B2 dτ,
where B is the resulting magnetic field. This suggests that the total energy stored
in electromagnetic fields, per unit volume, is
u =
1
2
ϵ0 E2 +
μ0
B2
. (8.5)
In this section I will confirm Eq. 8.5, and develop the energy conservation law for
electrodynamics.
Suppose we have some charge and current configuration which, at time t, pro-
duces fields E and B. In the next instant, dt, the charges move around a bit.
Question: How much work, d W , is done by the electromagnetic forces acting
on these charges, in the interval dt? According to the Lorentz force law, the work
done on a charge q is
1
F· dl= q(E + v × B)· v dt= qE· v dt.
In terms of the charge and current densities, q → ρdτ and ρv → J,
2 so the rate
at which work is done on all the charges in a volume V is
d W
dt=
V
(E· J)dτ. (8.6)
1The continuity equation is the only such constraint. Any functions ρ(r,t) and J(r, t) consistent
with Eq. 8.4 constitute possible charge and current densities, in the sense of admitting solutions to
Maxwell’s equations.
2This is a slippery equation: after all, if charges of both signs are present, the net charge density can
be zero even when the current is not—in fact, this is the case for ordinary current-carrying wires. We
should really treat the positive and negative charges separately, and combine the two to get Eq. 8.6,
with J= ρ+v+ + ρ−v−.
358 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws
Evidently E· J is the work done per unit time, per unit volume—which is to
say, the power delivered per unit volume. We can express this quantity in terms of
the fields alone, using the Ampère-Maxwell law to eliminate J:
1
E· J=
E· (∇ × B)− ϵ0E·
∂E
∂t.
μ0
From product rule 6,
∇· (E × B)= B· (∇ × E)− E· (∇ × B).
Invoking Faraday’s law (∇ × E= −∂B/∂t), it follows that
∂B
E· (∇ × B)= −B·
∂t− ∇· (E × B).

(E × B)· da, (8.9)
where S is the surface bounding V. This is Poynting’s theorem; it is the “work-
energy theorem” of electrodynamics. The first integral on the right is the total
energy stored in the fields, u dτ (Eq. 8.5). The second term evidently represents
the rate at which energy is transported out of V, across its boundary surface, by the
electromagnetic fields. Poynting’s theorem says, then, that the work done on the
charges by the electromagnetic force is equal to the decrease in energy remaining
in the fields, less the energy that flowed out through the surface.
The energy per unit time, per unit area, transported by the fields is called the
Poynting vector:
1
S ≡
(E × B). (8.10)
μ0
Specifically, S· da is the energy per unit time crossing the infinitesimal sur-
face da—the energy flux (so S is the energy flux density).3 We will see many
3If you’re very fastidious, you’ll notice a small gap in the logic here: We know from Eq. 8.9 that
S· da is the total power passing through a closed surface, but this does not prove that S· da is
the power passing through any open surface (there could be an extra term that integrates to zero over
all closed surfaces). This is, however, the obvious and natural interpretation; as always, the precise
location of energy is not really determined in electrodynamics (see Sect. 2.4.4).

mainly interested in using it to express Poynting’s theorem more compactly:
d W
dt= −
d
dt V
u dτ−
S
S· da. (8.11)
What if no work is done on the charges in V—what if, for example, we are in
a region of empty space, where there is no charge? In that case d W/dt= 0, so
∂u
∂t
dτ = − S· da = − (∇· S)dτ,
and hence
∂u
= −∇· S. (8.12)
∂t
This is the “continuity equation” for energy—u (energy density) plays the role of
ρ (charge density), and S takes the part of J (current density). It expresses local
conservation of electromagnetic energy.
In general, though, electromagnetic energy by itself is not conserved (nor is
the energy of the charges). Of course not! The fields do work on the charges, and
the charges create fields—energy is tossed back and forth between them. In the
overall energy economy, you must include the contributions of both the matter
and the fields.
Example 8.1. When current flows down a wire, work is done, which shows up
as Joule heating of the wire (Eq. 7.7). Though there are certainly easier ways to
do it, the energy per unit time delivered to the wire can be calculated using the
Poynting vector. Assuming it’s uniform, the electric field parallel to the wire is
V
E=
L,
where V is the potential difference between the ends and L is the length of the
wire (Fig. 8.1). The magnetic field is “circumferential”; at the surface (radius a)
it has the value

and it points radially inward. The energy per unit time passing in through the
surface of the wire is therefore
S· da = S(2πa L)= V I,
which is exactly what we concluded, on much more direct grounds, in Sect. 7.1.1.4
Problem 8.1 Calculate the power (energy per unit time) transported down the
cables of Ex. 7.13 and Prob. 7.62, assuming the two conductors are held at potential
difference V , and carry current I (down one and back up the other).
Problem 8.2 Consider the charging capacitor in Prob. 7.34.
(a) Find the electric and magnetic fields in the gap, as functions of the distance s
from the axis and the time t. (Assume the charge is zero at t = 0.)
(b) Find the energy density uem and the Poynting vector S in the gap. Note espe-
cially the direction of S. Check that Eq. 8.12 is satisfied.
(c) Determine the total energy in the gap, as a function of time. Calculate the total
power flowing into the gap, by integrating the Poynting vector over the appro-
priate surface. Check that the power input is equal to the rate of increase of
energy in the gap (Eq. 8.9—in this case W= 0, because there is no charge in
the gap). [If you’re worried about the fringing fields, do it for a volume of radius
b < a well inside the gap.]
8.2.1 8.2 MOMENTUM
Newton’s Third Law in Electrodynamics
Imagine a point charge q traveling in along the x axis at a constant speed v.
Because it is moving, its electric field is not given by Coulomb’s law; never-
theless, E still points radially outward from the instantaneous position of the
charge (Fig. 8.2a), as we’ll see in Chapter 10. Since, moreover, a moving point
charge does not constitute a steady current, its magnetic field is not given by the
Biot-Savart law. Nevertheless, it’s a fact that B still circles around the axis in a
manner suggested by the right-hand rule (Fig. 8.2b); again, the proof will come in
Chapter 10.
4What about energy flow down the wire? For a discussion, see M. K. Harbola, Am. J. Phys. 78, 1203
(2010). For a more sophisticated geometry, see B. S. Davis and L. Kaplan, Am. J. Phys. 79, 1155
(2011).

Now suppose this charge encounters an identical one, proceeding in at the same
speed along the y axis. Of course, the electromagnetic force between them would
tend to drive them off the axes, but let’s assume that they’re mounted on tracks,
or something, so they’re obliged to maintain the same direction and the same
speed (Fig. 8.3). The electric force between them is repulsive, but how about the
magnetic force? Well, the magnetic field of q1 points into the page (at the position
of q2), so the magnetic force on q2 is toward the right, whereas the magnetic
field of q2 is out of the page (at the position of q1), and the magnetic force on
q1 is upward. The net electromagnetic force of q1 on q2 is equal but not opposite
to the force of q2 on q1, in violation of Newton’s third law. In electrostatics and
magnetostatics the third law holds, but in electrodynamics it does not.
Well, that’s an interesting curiosity, but then, how often does one actually use
the third law, in practice? Answer: All the time! For the proof of conservation of
momentum rests on the cancellation of internal forces, which follows from the
third law. When you tamper with the third law, you are placing conservation of
momentum in jeopardy, and there is hardly any principle in physics more sacred
than that.
Momentum conservation is rescued, in electrodynamics, by the realization
that the fields themselves carry momentum. This is not so surprising when you

consider that we have already attributed energy to the fields. Whatever momen-
tum is lost to the particles is gained by the fields. Only when the field momentum
is added to the mechanical momentum is momentum conservation restored.
8.2.2 Maxwell’s Stress Tensor
Let’s calculate the total electromagnetic force on the charges in volume V:
F=
V
(E + v × B)ρ dτ =
V
(ρE + J × B)dτ. (8.13)
The force per unit volume is
f= ρE + J × B. (8.14)
As before, I propose to express this in terms of fields alone, eliminating ρ and
J by using Maxwell’s equations (i) and (iv):
f= ϵ0(∇· E)E +

and Faraday’s law says

Just to make things look more symmetrical, let’s throw in a term (∇· B)B;
since ∇· B= 0, this costs us nothing. Meanwhile, product rule 4 says
∇(E2)= 2(E· ∇)E + 2E × (∇ × E),
so
E × (∇ × E)=

The indices i and j refer to the coordinates x, y, and z, so the stress tensor has a
total of nine components (Tx x , Tyy , Tx z , Tyx , and so on). The Kronecker delta,
δi j , is 1 if the indices are the same (δx x = δyy = δzz = 1) and zero otherwise
(δx y = δx z = δyz = 0). Thus

Because it carries two indices, where a vector has only one, Ti j is sometimes

Physically, ↔ T is the force per unit area (or stress) acting on the surface. More
precisely, Ti j is the force (per unit area) in the i th direction acting on an ele-

represent pressures, and “off-diagonal” elements (Tx y , Tx z , etc.) are shears.

I hope you didn’t get too bogged down in the details of Ex. 8.2. If so, take a
moment to appreciate what happened. We were calculating the force on a solid
object, but instead of doing a volume integral, as you might expect, Eq. 8.21
allowed us to set it up as a surface integral; somehow the stress tensor sniffs
out what is going on inside.
Problem 8.3 Calculate the force of magnetic attraction between the northern
and southern hemispheres of a uniformly charged spinning spherical shell, with
radius R, angular velocity ω, and surface charge density σ. [This is the same as
Prob. 5.44, but this time use the Maxwell stress tensor and Eq. 8.21.]
Problem 8.4
(a) Consider two equal point charges q, separated by a distance 2a. Construct the
plane equidistant from the two charges. By integrating Maxwell’s stress tensor
over this plane, determine the force of one charge on the other.
(b) Do the same for charges that are opposite in sign.
8.2.3 Conservation of Momentum
According to Newton’s second law, the force on an object is equal to the rate of
change of its momentum:
F=
dpmech
dt.
8.2 Momentum 367
Equation 8.20 can therefore be written in the form5
dpmech
d
dt= −ϵ0μ0
dt V
S dτ +
↔ T· da, (8.27)
S
where pmech is the (mechanical) momentum of the particles in volume V. This
expression is similar in structure to Poynting’s theorem (Eq. 8.11), and it invites
an analogous interpretation: The first integral represents momentum stored in the
fields:
p= μ0ϵ0
V
S dτ, (8.28)
while the second integral is the momentum per unit time flowing in through the
surface.
Equation 8.27 is the statement of conservation of momentum in electro-
dynamics: If the mechanical momentum increases, either the field momentum
decreases, or else the fields are carrying momentum into the volume through the
surface. The momentum density in the fields is evidently
g= μ0ϵ0S= ϵ0(E × B), (8.29)
and the momentum flux transported by the fields is−
↔ T (specifically,−
↔ T· da is
the electromagnetic momentum per unit time passing through the area da).
If the mechanical momentum in V is not changing (for example, if we are
talking about a region of empty space), then
∂g
∂t
dτ =
↔ T· da = ∇·
↔ T dτ,
and hence
∂g
= ∇·
↔ T . (8.30)
∂t
This is the “continuity equation” for electromagnetic momentum, with g (momen-
tum density) in the role of ρ (charge density) and−
↔ T playing the part of J; it
expresses the local conservation of field momentum. But in general (when there
are charges around) the field momentum by itself, and the mechanical momentum
by itself, are not conserved—charges and fields exchange momentum, and only
the total is conserved.
Notice that the Poynting vector has appeared in two quite different roles: S
itself is the energy per unit area, per unit time, transported by the electromagnetic
fields, while μ0ϵ0S is the momentum per unit volume stored in those fields.6
5Let’s assume the only forces acting are electromagnetic. You can include other forces if you like—
both here and in the discussion of energy conservation—but they are just a distraction from the essen-
tial story.
6This is no coincidence—see R. P. Feynman, R. B. Leighton, and M. Sands, The Feynman Lectures
on Physics (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1964), Vol. II, Section 27-6.
368 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws
Similarly, ↔ T plays a dual role: ↔ T itself is the electromagnetic stress (force
per unit area) acting on a surface, and−
↔ T describes the flow of momentum (it is
the momentum current density) carried by the fields.
Example 8.3. A long coaxial cable, of length l, consists of an inner conductor
(radius a) and an outer conductor (radius b). It is connected to a battery at one end
and a resistor at the other (Fig. 8.5). The inner conductor carries a uniform charge
per unit length λ, and a steady current I to the right; the outer conductor has the
opposite charge and current. What is the electromagnetic momentum stored in the
fields?

Problem 8.5 Imagine two parallel infinite sheets, carrying uniform surface charge

at constant speed v (as in Problem 5.17).
(a) What is the electromagnetic momentum in a region of area A?
(b) Now suppose the top sheet moves slowly down (speed u) until it reaches the bot-
tom sheet, so the fields disappear. By calculating the total force on the charge
(q= σ A), show that the impulse delivered to the sheet is equal to the mo-
mentum originally stored in the fields. [Hint: As the upper plate passes by, the
magnetic field drops to zero, inducing an electric field that delivers an impulse
to the lower plate.]

Problem 8.7 Consider an infinite parallel-plate capacitor, with the lower plate (at
z = −d/2) carrying surface charge density−σ, and the upper plate (at z = +d/2)
carrying charge density +σ.

(b) Use Eq. 8.21 to determine the electromagnetic force per unit area on the top
plate. Compare Eq. 2.51.
(c) What is the electromagnetic momentum per unit area, per unit time, crossing
the x y plane (or any other plane parallel to that one, between the plates)?
(d) Of course, there must be mechanical forces holding the plates apart—perhaps
the capacitor is filled with insulating material under pressure. Suppose we sud-
denly remove the insulator; the momentum flux (c) is now absorbed by the
plates, and they begin to move. Find the momentum per unit time delivered to
the top plate (which is to say, the force acting on it) and compare your answer
to (b). [Note: This is not an additional force, but rather an alternative way of
calculating the same force—in (b) we got it from the force law, and in (d) we
do it by conservation of momentum.]
8.2.4 Angular Momentum
By now, the electromagnetic fields (which started out as mediators of forces
between charges) have taken on a life of their own. They carry energy (Eq. 8.5)

(b) appear to be consistent. See D. Babson, et al., Am. J. Phys. 77, 826 (2009).
8.2 Momentum 371
and, for that matter, angular momentum:
ℓ ℓ ℓ= r × g= ϵ0 [r × (E × B)]. (8.33)
Even perfectly static fields can harbor momentum and angular momentum, as
long as E × B is nonzero, and it is only when these field contributions are included
that the conservation laws are sustained.
Example 8.4. Imagine a very long solenoid with radius R, n turns per unit
length, and current I . Coaxial with the solenoid are two long cylindrical (non-
conducting) shells of length l—one, inside the solenoid at radius a, carries a
charge +Q, uniformly distributed over its surface; the other, outside the solenoid
at radius b, carries charge−Q (see Fig. 8.7; l is supposed to be much greater
than b). When the current in the solenoid is gradually reduced, the cylinders begin
to rotate, as we found in Ex. 7.8. Question: Where does the angular momentum
come from?8

8.3 Magnetic Forces Do No Work 373
Problem 8.8 In Ex. 8.4, suppose that instead of turning off the magnetic field (by
reducing I ) we turn off the electric field, by connecting a weakly10 conducting
radial spoke between the cylinders. (We’ll have to cut a slot in the solenoid, so
the cylinders can still rotate freely.) From the magnetic force on the current in the
spoke, determine the total angular momentum delivered to the cylinders, as they
discharge (they are now rigidly connected, so they rotate together). Compare the
initial angular momentum stored in the fields (Eq. 8.34). (Notice that the mechanism
by which angular momentum is transferred from the fields to the cylinders is entirely
different in the two cases: in Ex. 8.4 it was Faraday’s law, but here it is the Lorentz
force law.)

(a) Compute the angular momentum stored in the electromagnetic fields.
(b) Suppose the sphere is gradually (and uniformly) demagnetized (perhaps by
heating it up past the Curie point). Use Faraday’s law to determine the induced
electric field, find the torque this field exerts on the sphere, and calculate the
total angular momentum imparted to the sphere in the course of the demagneti-
zation.
(c) Suppose instead of demagnetizing the sphere we discharge it, by connecting a
grounding wire to the north pole. Assume the current flows over the surface in
such a way that the charge density remains uniform. Use the Lorentz force law
to determine the torque on the sphere, and calculate the total angular momentum
imparted to the sphere in the course of the discharge. (The magnetic field is
discontinuous at the surface . . . does this matter?) [Answer: 2

MAGNETIC FORCES DO NO WORK12
This is perhaps a good place to revisit the old paradox that magnetic forces do no
work (Eq. 5.11). What about that magnetic crane lifting the carcass of a junked
car? Somebody is doing work on the car, and if it’s not the magnetic field, who
10In Ex. 8.4 we turned the current off slowly, to keep things quasistatic; here we reduce the electric
field slowly to keep the displacement current negligible.
11This version of the Feynman disk paradox was proposed by N. L. Sharma (Am. J. Phys. 56, 420
(1988)); similar models were analyzed by E. M. Pugh and G. E. Pugh, Am. J. Phys. 35, 153 (1967)
and by R. H. Romer, Am. J. Phys. 35, 445 (1967).
12This section can be skipped without loss of continuity. I include it for those readers who are disturbed
by the notion that magnetic forces do no work.

is it? The car is ferromagnetic; in the presence of the magnetic field, it contains
a lot of microscopic magnetic dipoles (spinning electrons, actually), all lined up.
The resulting magnetization is equivalent to a bound current running around the
surface, so let’s model the car as a circular current loop—in fact, let’s make it an
insulating ring of line charge λ rotating at angular velocity ω (Fig. 8.8).
The upward magnetic force on the loop is (Eq. 6.2)
F= 2π I a Bs , (8.35)
where Bs is the radial component of the magnet’s field,13 and I= λωa. If the ring
rises a distance dz (while the magnet itself stays put), the work done on it is
d W= 2πa2λωBs dz. (8.36)
This increases the potential energy of the ring. Who did the work? Naively, it ap-
pears that the magnetic field is responsible, but we have already learned (Ex. 5.3)
that this is not the case—as the ring rises, the magnetic force is perpendicular to
the net velocity of the charges in the ring, so it does no work on them.
At the same time, however, a motional emf is induced in the ring, which
opposes the flow of charge, and hence reduces its angular velocity:

and the work done (slowing the rotation) is N dφ= N ω dt, or
d W= −2πa2λωBs dz. (8.38)
The ring slows down, and the rotational energy it loses (Eq. 8.38) is precisely
equal to the potential energy it gains (Eq. 8.36). All the magnetic field did was
convert energy from one form to another. If you’ll permit some sloppy language,
the work done by the vertical component of the magnetic force (Eq. 8.35) is equal
and opposite to the work done by its horizontal component (Eq. 8.37).14
What about the magnet? Is it completely passive in this process? Suppose we
model it as a big circular loop (radius b), resting on a table and carrying a current
Ib; the “junk car” is a relatively small current loop (radius a), on the floor directly
below, carrying a current Ia (Fig. 8.10). This time, just for a change, let’s assume
both currents are constant (we’ll include a regulated power supply in each loop15).
Parallel currents attract, and we propose to lift the small loop off the floor, keeping
careful track of the work done and the agency responsible.

14This argument is essentially the same as the one in Ex. 5.3, except that in this case I told the story
in terms of motional emf, instead of the Lorentz force law. But after all, the flux rule is a consequence
of the Lorentz force law.
15The lower loop could be a single spinning electron, in which case quantum mechanics fixes its
angular momentum at¯ h/2. It might appear that this sustains the current, with no need for a power
supply. I will return to this point, but for now let’s just keep quantum mechanics out of it.
376 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws
Let’s start by adjusting the currents so the small ring just “floats,” a distance
h below the table, with the magnetic force exactly balancing the weight (ma g) of
the little ring. I’ll let you calculate the magnetic force (Prob. 8.11):

Who did it? The magnetic field? No! The work was done by the power supply
that sustains the current in loop a (Ex. 5.3). As the loop rises, a motional emf is
induced in it. The flux through the loop is
a = M Ib,
where M is the mutual inductance of the two loops:

and the work done by the power supply in ring b (to sustain the current Ib) is

energy go? Answer: It increased the energy stored in the fields. The energy in a
system of two current-carrying loops is (see Prob. 8.12)

Remarkably, all four energy increments are the same. If we care to apportion
things this way, the power supply in loop a contributes the energy necessary to lift
the lower ring, while the power supply in loop b provides the extra energy for the
fields. If all we’re interested in is the work done to raise the ring, we can ignore
the upper loop (and the energy in the fields) altogether.
In both these models, the magnet itself was stationary. That’s like lifting a
paper clip by holding a magnet over it. But in the case of the magnetic crane, the
car stays in contact with the magnet, which is attached to a cable that lifts the
whole works. As a model, we might stick the upper loop in a big box, the lower
loop in a little box, and crank up the currents so the force of attraction is much
greater than ma g; the two boxes snap together, and we attach a string to the upper
box and pull up on it (Fig. 8.11).
The same old mechanism (Ex. 5.3) prevails: as the lower loop rises, the mag-
netic force tilts backwards; its vertical component lifts the loop, but its horizontal
component opposes the current, and no net work is done. This time, however, the
motional emf is perfectly balanced by the Faraday emf fighting to keep the current
going—the flux through the lower loop is not changing. (If you like, the flux is
increasing because the loop is moving upward, into a region of higher magnetic
field, but it is decreasing because the magnetic field of the upper loop—at any give
point in space—is decreasing as that loop moves up.) No power supply is needed
to sustain the current (and for that matter, no power supply is required in the upper
loop either, since the energy in the fields is not changing. Who did the work to lift
the car? The person pulling up on the rope, obviously. The role of the magnetic
field was merely to transmit this energy to the car, via the vertical component of
the magnetic force. But the magnetic field itself (as always) did no work.
FIGURE 8.11
378 Chapter 8 Conservation Laws
The fact that magnetic fields do no work follows directly from the Lorentz
force law, so if you think you have discovered an exception, you’re going to have
to explain why that law is incorrect. For example, if magnetic monopoles exist,
the force on a particle with electric charge qe and magnetic charge qm becomes
(Prob. 7.38):
F= qe(E + v × B) + qm (B− ϵ0μ0v × E) . (8.44)
In that case, magnetic fields can do work . . . but only on magnetic charges. So
unless your car is made of monopoles (I don’t think so), this doesn’t solve the
problem.
A somewhat less radical possibility is that in addition to electric charges there
exist permanent point magnetic dipoles (electrons?), whose dipole moment m is
not associated with any electric current, but simply is. The Lorentz force law
acquires an extra term
F= q(E + v × B) + ∇(m· B).
The magnetic field can do work on these “intrinsic” dipoles (which experience
no motional or Faraday emf, since they enclose no flux). I don’t know whether a
consistent theory can be constructed in this way, but in any event it is not classical
electrodynamics, which is predicated on Ampère’s assumption that all magnetic
phenomena are due to electric charges in motion, and point magnetic dipoles must
be interpreted as the limits of tiny current loops.

(c) According to the Einstein formula (E= mc2), the energy in the fields should
contribute to the mass of the electron. Lorentz and others speculated that the
entire mass of the electron might be accounted for in this way: Uem = me c2
.
Suppose, moreover, that the electron’s spin angular momentum is entirely
attributable to the electromagnetic fields: Lem =
¯ h/2. On these two assump-
tions, determine the radius and angular velocity of the electron. What is their
product, ωR? Does this classical model make sense?

magnetic charge. [Hint: Start with the generalized Maxwell equations (7.44) and
Lorentz force law (Eq. 8.44), and follow the derivations in Sections 8.1.2, 8.2.2,
and 8.2.3.]

Problem 8.20 Consider an ideal stationary magnetic dipole m in a static electric
field E. Show that the fields carry momentum
p= −ϵ0μ0(m × E). (8.45)
[Hint: There are several ways to do this. The simplest method is to start with
p= ϵ0 (E × B)dτ, write E= −∇V , and use integration by parts to show that
p= ϵ0μ0 V J dτ.
So far, this is valid for any localized static configuration. For a current confined
to an infinitesimal neighborhood of the origin we can approximate V (r) ≈ V (0)−
E(0)· r. Treat the dipole as a current loop, and use Eqs. 5.82 and 1.108.]21
Problem 8.21 Because the cylinders in Ex. 8.4 are left rotating (at angular veloci-
ties ωa and ωb , say), there is actually a residual magnetic field, and hence angular
momentum in the fields, even after the current in the solenoid has been extinguished.
If the cylinders are heavy, this correction will be negligible, but it is interesting to
do the problem without making that assumption.22
(a) Calculate (in terms of ωa and ωb ) the final angular momentum in the fields.
[Define ω ω ω = ωˆ
z, so ωa and ωb could be positive or negative.]
(b) As the cylinders begin to rotate, their changing magnetic field induces an extra
azimuthal electric field, which, in turn, will make an additional contribution to

ences.
20Note that this result is independent of the separation distance d! It points from qe toward qm . In
quantum mechanics, angular momentum comes in half-integer multiples of¯ h, so this result suggests
that if magnetic monopoles exist, electric and magnetic charge must be quantized: μ0qe qm /4π =
n¯ h/2, for n = 1,2, 3, . . . , an idea first proposed by Dirac in 1931. If even one monopole is lurking
somewhere in the universe, this would “explain” why electric charge comes in discrete units. (How-
ever, see D. Singleton, Am. J. Phys. 66, 697 (1998) for a cautionary note.)
21As it stands, Eq. 8.45 is valid only for ideal dipoles. But g is linear in B, and therefore, if E is held
fixed, obeys the superposition principle: For a collection of magnetic dipoles, the total momentum is
the (vector) sum of the momenta for each one separately. In particular, if E is uniform over a localized
steady current distribution, then Eq. 8.45 is valid for the whole thing, only now m is the total magnetic
dipole moment.

9 Electromagnetic Waves
9.1 WAVES IN ONE DIMENSION
9.1.1 The Wave Equation
What is a “wave”? I don’t think I can give you an entirely satisfactory answer—the
concept is intrinsically somewhat vague—but here’s a start: A wave is a distur-
bance of a continuous medium that propagates with a fixed shape at constant ve-
locity. Immediately I must add qualifiers: In the presence of absorption, the wave
will diminish in size as it moves; if the medium is dispersive, different frequencies
travel at different speeds; in two or three dimensions, as the wave spreads out, its
amplitude will decrease; and of course standing waves don’t propagate at all. But
these are refinements; let’s start with the simple case: fixed shape, constant speed
(Fig. 9.1).
How would you represent such an object mathematically? In the figure, I have
drawn the wave at two different times, once at t = 0, and again at some later
time t—each point on the wave form simply shifts to the right by an amount vt,
where v is the velocity. Maybe the wave is generated by shaking one end of a taut
string; f (z,t) represents the displacement of the string at the point z, at time t.
Given the initial shape of the string, g(z) ≡ f (z,0), what is the subsequent form,
f (z,t)? Well, the displacement at point z, at the later time t, is the same as the
displacement a distance vt to the left (i.e. at z− vt), back at time t = 0:
f (z,t)= f (z− vt,0)= g(z− vt). (9.1)
That statement captures (mathematically) the essence of wave motion. It tells us
that the function f (z,t), which might have depended on z and t in any old way,
in fact depends on them only in the very special combination z− vt; when that

is true, the function f (z,t) represents a wave of fixed shape traveling in the z
direction at speed v. For example, if A and b are constants (with the appropriate
units),
A
f1(z,t)= Ae−b(z−vt)2
, f2(z,t)= A sin[b(z− vt)], f3(z,t)=
b(z− vt)2 + 1
all represent waves (with different shapes, of course), but
f4(z,t)= Ae−b(bz2 +vt)
, and f5(z,t)= A sin(bz)cos(bvt)3
,
do not.
Why does a stretched string support wave motion? Actually, it follows from
Newton’s second law. Imagine a very long string under tension T . If it is displaced
from equilibrium, the net transverse force on the segment between z and z + z
(Fig. 9.2) is
F= T sin θ′
− T sin θ,
where θ′ is the angle the string makes with the z-direction at point z + z, and
θ is the corresponding angle at point z. Provided that the distortion of the string
is not too great, these angles are small (the figure is exaggerated, obviously), and
we can replace the sine by the tangent:

Evidently, small disturbances on the string satisfy

where v (which, as we’ll soon see, represents the speed of propagation) is

Equation 9.2 is known as the (classical) wave equation, because it admits as
solutions all functions of the form
f (z,t)= g(z− vt), (9.4)
(that is, all functions that depend on the variables z and t in the special combi-
nation u ≡ z− vt), and we have just learned that such functions represent waves
propagating in the z direction with speed v. For Eq. 9.4 means

Note that g(u) can be any (differentiable) function whatever. If the disturbance
propagates without changing its shape, then it satisfies the wave equation.
But functions of the form g(z− vt) are not the only solutions. The wave equa-
tion involves the square of v, so we can generate another class of solutions by
simply changing the sign of the velocity:
f (z,t)= h(z + vt). (9.5)
This, of course, represents a wave propagating in the negative z direction, and it is
certainly reasonable (on physical grounds) that such solutions would be allowed.
What is perhaps surprising is that the most general solution to the wave equation
is the sum of a wave to the right and a wave to the left:
f (z,t)= g(z− vt) + h(z + vt). (9.6)
9.1 Waves in One Dimension 385
(Notice that the wave equation is linear: The sum of any two solutions is itself a
solution.) Every solution to the wave equation can be expressed in this form.
Like the simple harmonic oscillator equation, the wave equation is ubiquitous
in physics. If something is vibrating, the oscillator equation is almost certainly
responsible (at least, for small amplitudes), and if something is waving (whether
the context is mechanics or acoustics, optics or oceanography), the wave equation
(perhaps with some decoration) is bound to be involved.
Problem 9.1 By explicit differentiation, check that the functions f1, f2, and f3 in
the text satisfy the wave equation. Show that f4 and f5 do not.
Problem 9.2 Show that the standing wave f (z, t)= A sin(kz) cos(kvt) satisfies
the wave equation, and express it as the sum of a wave traveling to the left and a
wave traveling to the right (Eq. 9.6).
9.1.2 Sinusoidal Waves
(i) Terminology. Of all possible wave forms, the sinusoidal one
f (z,t)= A cos[k(z− vt) + δ] (9.7)
is (for good reason) the most familiar. Figure 9.3 shows this function at time t = 0.
A is the amplitude of the wave (it is positive, and represents the maximum dis-
placement from equilibrium). The argument of the cosine is called the phase, and
δ is the phase constant (obviously, you can add any integer multiple of 2π to δ
without changing f (z,t); ordinarily, one uses a value in the range 0 ≤ δ < 2π).
Notice that at z = vt− δ/k, the phase is zero; let’s call this the “central maxi-
mum.” If δ= 0, the central maximum passes the origin at time t = 0; more gen-
erally, δ/k is the distance by which the central maximum (and therefore the entire
wave) is “delayed.” Finally, k is the wave number; it is related to the wavelength
λ by the equation
2π
λ=
k, (9.8)
for when z advances by 2π/k, the cosine executes one complete cycle.

For our purposes, a more convenient unit is the angular frequency ω, so-called
because in the analogous case of uniform circular motion, it represents the number
of radians swept out per unit time:
ω = 2πν = kv. (9.11)
Ordinarily, it’s nicer to write sinusoidal waves (Eq. 9.7) in terms of ω, rather
than v:
f (z,t)= A cos(kz− ωt + δ). (9.12)
A sinusoidal oscillation of wave number k and (angular) frequency ω traveling
to the left would be written
f (z,t)= A cos (kz + ωt− δ). (9.13)
The sign of the phase constant is chosen for consistency with our previous con-
vention that δ/k shall represent the distance by which the wave is “delayed” (since
the wave is now moving to the left, a delay means a shift to the right). At t = 0,
the wave looks like Fig. 9.4. Because the cosine is an even function, we can just
as well write Eq. 9.13 thus:
f (z,t)= A cos(−kz− ωt + δ). (9.14)
Comparison with Eq. 9.12 reveals that, in effect, we could simply switch the sign
of k to produce a wave with the same amplitude, phase constant, frequency, and
wavelength, traveling in the opposite direction.

(ii) Complex notation. In view of Euler’s formula,
ei θ
= cos θ + i sin θ, (9.15)
the sinusoidal wave (Eq. 9.12) can be written
f (z,t)= Re Aei (kz−ωt+δ)
, (9.16)
where Re(ξ) denotes the real part of the complex number ξ. This invites us to
introduce the complex wave function
˜
f (z,t) ≡
˜
Aei (kz−ωt)
, (9.17)
with the complex amplitude˜
A ≡ Aei δ absorbing the phase constant. The actual
wave function is the real part of˜
f :
˜
f (z,t)= Re[
f (z,t)]. (9.18)
If you know˜
f , it is a simple matter to find f ; the advantage of the complex
notation is that exponentials are much easier to manipulate than sines and cosines.
Example 9.1. Suppose you want to combine two sinusoidal waves:
˜

f3 = f1 + f2 = Re(

f2)= Re(

˜
˜
f2)= Re(
f3),
with˜

f3 =

wave number,
˜
f2. You simply add the corresponding complex wave functions,
and then take the real part. In particular, if they have the same frequency and
˜
f3 =
˜
A1ei (kz−ωt) +
˜
A2ei (kz−ωt) =
˜
A3ei (kz−ωt)
,
where
˜
A3 =
˜
A1 +
˜
A2, or A3ei δ3 = A1ei δ1 + A2ei δ2
. (9.19)
In other words, you just add the (complex) amplitudes. The combined wave still
has the same frequency and wavelength,
f3(z,t)= A3 cos (kz− ωt + δ3),
and you can easily figure out A3 and δ3 from Eq. 9.19 (Prob. 9.3). Try doing
this without using the complex notation—you will find yourself looking up trig
identities and slogging through nasty algebra.
(iii) Linear combinations of sinusoidal waves. Although the sinusoidal function
(Eq. 9.17) is a very special wave form, the fact is that any wave can be expressed
as a linear combination of sinusoidal ones:
˜
f (z,t)=
∞
−∞
˜
A(k)ei (kz−ωt) dk. (9.20)
388 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves
Here ω is a function of k (Eq. 9.11), and I have allowed k to run through negative
values in order to include waves going both directions.1
The formula for˜
A(k), in terms of the initial conditions f (z,0) and˙
f (z,0),
can be obtained from the theory of Fourier transforms (see Prob. 9.33), but the
details are not relevant to my purpose here. The point is that any wave can be
written as a linear combination of sinusoidal waves, and therefore if you know
how sinusoidal waves behave, you know in principle how any wave behaves. So
from now on, we shall confine our attention to sinusoidal waves.
Problem 9.3 Use Eq. 9.19 to determine A3 and δ3 in terms of A1, A2, δ1, and δ2.
Problem 9.4 Obtain Eq. 9.20 directly from the wave equation, by separation of
variables.
9.1.3 Boundary Conditions: Reflection and Transmission
So far, I have assumed the string is infinitely long—or at any rate long enough that
we don’t need to worry about what happens to a wave when it reaches the end. As
a matter of fact, what happens depends a lot on how the string is attached—that
is, on the specific boundary conditions to which the wave is subject. Suppose,
for instance, that the string is simply tied onto a second string. The tension T is
the same for both, but the mass per unit length μ presumably is not, and hence
the wave velocities v1 and v2 are different (remember, v = √T /μ). Let’s say, for
convenience, that the knot occurs at z = 0. The incident wave
˜
fI (z,t)=
˜
AI ei (k1 z−ωt), (z < 0), (9.21)
coming in from the left, gives rise to a reflected wave
˜
fR (z,t)=
˜
AR ei (−k1 z−ωt), (z < 0), (9.22)
traveling back along string 1 (hence the minus sign in front of k1), in addition to
a transmitted wave
˜
fT (z,t)=
˜
AT ei (k2 z−ωt), (z > 0), (9.23)
which continues on to the right in string 2.
The incident wave fI (z,t) is a sinusoidal oscillation that extends (in principle)
all the way back to z = −∞, and has been doing so for all of history. The same
goes for fR and fT (except that the latter, of course, extends to z = +∞). All parts
of the system are oscillating at the same frequency ω (a frequency determined by
the person at z = −∞, who is shaking the string in the first place). Since the
1This does not mean that λ and ω are negative—wavelength and frequency are always positive. If
we allow negative wave numbers, then Eqs. 9.8 and 9.11 should really be written λ= 2π/|k| and
ω = |k|v.

wave velocities are different in the two strings, however, the wavelengths and
wave numbers are also different:

v2
Of course, this situation is pretty artificial—what’s more, with incident and re-
flected waves of infinite extent traveling on the same piece of string, it’s going to
be hard for a spectator to tell them apart. You might therefore prefer to consider
an incident wave of finite extent—say, the pulse shown in Fig. 9.5. You can work
out the details for yourself, if you like (Prob. 9.5). The trouble with this approach
is that no finite pulse is truly sinusoidal. The waves in Fig. 9.5 may look like sine
functions, but they’re not: they’re little pieces of sines, joined onto an entirely dif-
ferent function (namely, zero). Like any other waves, they can be built up as linear
combinations of true sinusoidal functions (Eq. 9.20), but only by putting together
a whole range of frequencies and wavelengths. If you want a single incident fre-
quency (as we shall in the electromagnetic case), you must let your waves extend
to infinity. (In practice, if you use a very long pulse, with many oscillations, it will
be close to the ideal of a single frequency.)
For a sinusoidal incident wave, then, the net disturbance of the string is:
˜
f (z,t)=
⎧ ⎨ ⎩˜
AI ei (k1 z−ωt) +
˜
AR ei (−k1 z−ωt)
, for z < 0,
˜
AT ei (k2 z−ωt)
, for z > 0.
(9.25)
At the join (z = 0), the displacement just slightly to the left (z = 0−) must equal
the displacement slightly to the right (z = 0+)—else there would be a break
between the two strings. Mathematically, f (z,t) is continuous at z = 0:
f (0−
,t)= f (0+
,t). (9.26)
If the knot itself is of negligible mass, then the derivative of f must also be
continuous:

Otherwise there would be a net force on the knot, and therefore an infinite
acceleration (Fig. 9.6). These boundary conditions apply directly to the real wave
function f (z,t). But since the imaginary part of˜
f differs from the real part only
in the replacement of cosine by sine (Eq. 9.15), it follows that the complex wave
function˜
f (z,t) obeys the same rules:

When applied to Eq. 9.25, these boundary conditions determine the outgoing
amplitudes (˜

AT ) in terms of the incoming one (˜
AI ):
˜

˜
AR =

from which it follows that

˜

˜

˜
AT =
2v2
v2 + v1
˜

The real amplitudes and phases, then, are related by
AR ei δR =
v2− v1
v2 + v1
AI ei δI
, AT ei δT =
2v2
v2 + v1
AI ei δI
. (9.31)
If the second string is lighter than the first (μ2 < μ1, so that v2 > v1), all three
waves have the same phase angle (δR = δT = δI ), and the outgoing amplitudes
are
AR =
v2− v1
v2 + v1
AI , AT =
2v2
v2 + v1
AI. (9.32)
If the second string is heavier than the first (v2 < v1), the reflected wave is out of
phase by 180◦ (δR + π = δT = δI ). In other words, since
cos (−k1 z− ωt + δI− π)= −cos (−k1 z− ωt + δI ),
9.1 Waves in One Dimension 391
the reflected wave is “upside down.” The amplitudes in this case are
AR =
v1− v2
v2 + v1
AI and AT =
2v2
v2 + v1
AI. (9.33)
In particular, if the second string is infinitely massive—or, what amounts to the
same thing, if the first string is simply nailed down at the end—then
AR = AI and AT = 0.
Naturally, in this case there is no transmitted wave—all of it reflects back.

Problem 9.5 Suppose you send an incident wave of specified shape, gI (z− v1t),
down string number 1. It gives rise to a reflected wave, h R (z + v1t), and a transmit-
ted wave, gT (z− v2t). By imposing the boundary conditions 9.26 and 9.27, find h R
and gT.
Problem 9.6

9.1.4 Polarization
The waves that travel down a string when you shake it are called transverse,
because the displacement is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. If the
string is reasonably elastic, it is also possible to stimulate compression waves, by
giving the string little tugs. Compression waves are hard to see on a string, but if
you try it with a slinky they’re quite noticeable (Fig. 9.7). These waves are called
longitudinal, because the displacement from equilibrium is along the direction of
392 Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves
FIGURE 9.7
propagation. Sound waves, which are nothing but compression waves in air, are
longitudinal; electromagnetic waves, as we shall see, are transverse.
Now there are, of course, two dimensions perpendicular to any given line of
propagation. Accordingly, transverse waves occur in two independent states of
polarization: you can shake the string up-and-down (“vertical” polarization—
Fig. 9.8a),
˜
fv(z,t)=

or left-and-right (“horizontal” polarization—Fig. 9.8b),

Problem 9.8 Equation 9.36 describes the most general linearly polarized wave on
a string. Linear (or “plane”) polarization (so called because the displacement is par-
allel to a fixed vectorˆ
n) results from the combination of horizontally and vertically
polarized waves of the same phase (Eq. 9.39). If the two components are of equal
amplitude, but out of phase by 90◦ (say, δv = 0, δh = 90◦), the result is a circularly
polarized wave. In that case:
(a) At a fixed point z, show that the string moves in a circle about the z axis. Does it
go clockwise or counterclockwise, as you look down the axis toward the origin?
How would you construct a wave circling the other way? (In optics, the clock-
wise case is called right circular polarization, and the counterclockwise, left
circular polarization.)3
(b) Sketch the string at time t = 0.
(c) How would you shake the string in order to produce a circularly polarized wave?

The Wave Equation for E and B
In regions of space where there is no charge or current, Maxwell’s equations read

They constitute a set of coupled, first-order, partial differential equations for E
and B. They can be decoupled by applying the curl to (iii) and (iv):
∇ × (∇ × E)= ∇(∇· E) − ∇2E= ∇ × −

3An elegant notation for circular polarization (or elliptical, if the amplitudes are unequal) is to use a
complexˆ

We now have separate equations for E and B, but they are of second order; that’s
the price you pay for decoupling them.
In vacuum, then, each Cartesian component of E and B satisfies the three-
dimensional wave equation,

(This is the same as Eq. 9.2, except that ∂2 f /∂z2 is replaced by its natural gen-

propagation of electromagnetic waves, traveling at a speed

which happens to be precisely the velocity of light, c. The implication is astound-
ing: Perhaps light is an electromagnetic wave.4 Of course, this conclusion does
not surprise anyone today, but imagine what a revelation it was in Maxwell’s time!
Remember how ϵ0 and μ0 came into the theory in the first place: they were con-
stants in Coulomb’s law and the Biot-Savart law, respectively. You measure them
in experiments involving charged pith balls, batteries, and wires—experiments
having nothing whatever to do with light. And yet, according to Maxwell’s the-
ory, you can calculate c from these two numbers. Notice the crucial role played by
Maxwell’s contribution to Ampère’s law (μ0ϵ0∂E/∂t); without it, the wave equa-
tion would not emerge, and there would be no electromagnetic theory of light.
9.2.2 Monochromatic Plane Waves
For reasons discussed in Sect. 9.1.2, we may confine our attention to sinusoidal
waves of frequency ω. Since different frequencies in the visible range correspond
to different colors, such waves are called monochromatic (Table 9.1). Suppose,
4As Maxwell himself put it, “We can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in the transverse
undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.” See Ivan
Tolstoy, James Clerk Maxwell, A Biography (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983).

moreover, that the waves are traveling in the z direction and have no x or y depen-
dence; these are called plane waves,
5 because the fields are uniform over every
plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation (Fig. 9.9). We are interested,
then, in fields of the form
˜
E(z,t)=
˜
E0ei (kz−ωt)

˜
B(z,t)=

where˜
E0 and˜
B0 are the (complex) amplitudes (the physical fields, of course, are
the real parts of˜
E and˜
B), and ω = ck.
Now, the wave equations for E and B (Eq. 9.41) were derived from Maxwell’s
equations. However, whereas every solution to Maxwell’s equations (in empty
space) must obey the wave equation, the converse is not true; Maxwell’s equa-
tions impose extra constraints on˜
E0 and˜
B0. In particular, since ∇· E= 0 and
∇· B= 0, it follows6 that
˜
˜
(
E0)z = (

That is, electromagnetic waves are transverse: the electric and magnetic fields are
perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Moreover, Faraday’s law, ∇ × E=
−∂B/∂t, implies a relation between the electric and magnetic amplitudes, to wit:
˜

Or work Prob. 9.35. Of course, over small enough regions any wave is essentially plane, as long as the
wavelength is much less than the radius of the curvature of the wave front.
6Because the real part of˜
E differs from the imaginary part only in the replacement of sine by cosine,
if the former obeys Maxwell’s equations, so does the latter, and hence˜
E as well.

This is the paradigm for a monochromatic plane wave (see Fig. 9.10). The wave
as a whole is said to be polarized in the x direction (by convention, we use the
direction of E to specify the polarization of an electromagnetic wave).
There is nothing special about the z direction, of course—we can easily gen-
eralize to monochromatic plane waves traveling in an arbitrary direction. The no-
tation is facilitated by the introduction of the propagation (or wave) vector, k,
pointing in the direction of propagation, whose magnitude is the wave number k.
The scalar product k· r is the appropriate generalization of kz (Fig. 9.11), so

so the electric and magnetic contributions are equal:
u = ϵ0 E2
= ϵ0 E2

As the wave travels, it carries this energy along with it. The energy flux den-
sity (energy per unit area, per unit time) transported by the fields is given by the
Poynting vector (Eq. 8.10):

Notice that S is the energy density (u) times the velocity of the waves (cˆ

should be. For in a time t, a length c t passes through area A (Fig. 9.12), carry-
ing with it an energy u Ac t. The energy per unit time, per unit area, transported
by the wave is therefore uc.
Electromagnetic fields not only carry energy, they also carry momentum. In
fact, we found in Eq. 8.29 that the momentum density stored in the fields is

In the case of light, the wavelength is so short (∼ 5 × 10−7 m), and the period
so brief (∼ 10−15 s), that any macroscopic measurement will encompass many
cycles. Typically, therefore, we’re not interested in the fluctuating cosine-squared
term in the energy and momentum densities; all we want is the average value.
Now, the average of cosine-squared over a complete cycle7 is 1

7There is a cute trick for doing this in your head: sin2 θ + cos2 θ= 1, and over a complete cycle the
average of sin2 θ is equal to the average of cos2 θ, so ⟨sin2⟩ = ⟨cos2⟩ = 1/2. More formally,

When light falls (at normal incidence) on a perfect absorber, it delivers its
momentum to the surface. In a time t, the momentum transfer is (Fig. 9.12)

(On a perfect reflector the pressure is twice as great, because the momentum
switches direction, instead of simply being absorbed.) We can account for this
pressure qualitatively, as follows: The electric field (Eq. 9.48) drives charges in
the x direction, and the magnetic field then exerts on them a force q(v × B) in the
z direction. The net force on all the charges in the surface produces the pressure.8
Problem 9.10 The intensity of sunlight hitting the earth is about 1300 W/m2. If
sunlight strikes a perfect absorber, what pressure does it exert? How about a perfect
reflector? What fraction of atmospheric pressure does this amount to?
Problem 9.11 Consider a particle of charge q and mass m, free to move in the
x y plane in response to an electromagnetic wave propagating in the z direction
(Eq. 9.48—might as well set δ= 0).
(a) Ignoring the magnetic force, find the velocity of the particle, as a function of
time. (Assume the average velocity is zero.)
(b) Now calculate the resulting magnetic force on the particle.
(c) Show that the (time) average magnetic force is zero.
The problem with this naive model for the pressure of light is that the velocity is
90◦ out of phase with the fields. For energy to be absorbed, there’s got to be some
resistance to the motion of the charges. Suppose we include a force of the form
−γmv, for some damping constant γ.
(d) Repeat part (a) (ignore the exponentially damped transient). Repeat part (b), and
find the average magnetic force on the particle.9
Problem 9.12 In the complex notation there is a clever device for finding the
time average of a product. Suppose f (r, t)= A cos (k· r− ωt + δa ) and g(r,t)=
˜
B cos (k· r− ωt + δb ). Show that ⟨ f g⟩ = (1/2)Re(
f˜
g∗), where the star denotes
complex conjugation. [Note that this only works if the two waves have the same k
and ω, but they need not have the same amplitude or phase.] For example,

(Eq. 9.48). Does your answer make sense? (Remember that−

momentum flux density.) How is the momentum flux density related to the energy
density, in this case?

10 This observation is mathematically pretty trivial, but the physical implications are astonishing: As
the wave passes through, the fields busily polarize and magnetize all the molecules, and the resulting
(oscillating) dipoles create their own electric and magnetic fields. These combine with the original
fields in such a way as to create a single wave with the same frequency but a different speed. This
extraordinary conspiracy (known in optics as the Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem) is responsible
for the phenomenon of transparency. It is a distinctly nontrivial consequence of linearity. For further
discussion see M. B. James and D. J. Griffiths, Am. J. Phys. 60, 309 (1992); H. Fearn, D. F. V. James,

These equations relate the electric and magnetic fields just to the left and just to
the right of the interface between two linear media. In the following sections, we
use them to deduce the laws governing reflection and refraction of electromag-
netic waves.
11 The dielectric constant is “constant” in the sense of being independent of the amplitude of E, but
it may well depend on the frequency, as we shall see. Thus, for example, if you quote the (static)
dielectric constant for water, from Table 4.2, you will conclude that the index of refraction is 8.9,
which is wildly off, for visible light (n = 1.33).
12 See Prob. 8.23; refer to Sect. 4.4.3 for the precise meaning of “energy density,” in the context of

as conservation of energy, of course, requires. For instance, when light passes
from air (n1 = 1) into glass (n2 = 1.5), R= 0.04 and T= 0.96. No surprise:
most of the light is transmitted.
Problem 9.14 Calculate the exact reflection and transmission coefficients, without
assuming μ1 = μ2 = μ0. Confirm that R + T= 1.
Problem 9.15 In writing Eqs. 9.76 and 9.77, I tacitly assumed that the reflected
and transmitted waves have the same polarization as the incident wave—along the
x direction. Prove that this must be so. [Hint: Let the polarization vectors of the
transmitted and reflected waves be

and prove from the boundary conditions that θT = θR = 0.]
9.3.3 Reflection and Transmission at Oblique Incidence
In the last section, I treated reflection and transmission at normal incidence—that
is, when the incoming wave hits the interface head-on. We now turn to the more
general case of oblique incidence, in which the incoming wave meets the bound-
ary at an arbitrary angle θI (Fig. 9.14). Of course, normal incidence is really just a
special case of oblique incidence, with θI = 0, but I wanted to treat it separately,
as a kind of warm-up, because the algebra is now going to get a little heavy.
Suppose, then, that a monochromatic plane wave

( )ei (kI·r−ωt) + ( )ei (kR·r−ωt) = ( )ei (kT·r−ωt)
, at z = 0. (9.93)
I’ll fill in the parentheses in a moment; for now, the important thing to notice is
that the x, y, and t dependence is confined to the exponents. Because the boundary
conditions must hold at all points on the plane, and for all times, these exponential
factors must be equal (when z = 0). Otherwise, a slight change in x, say, would
destroy the equality (see Prob. 9.16). Of course, the time factors are already equal
(in fact, you could regard this as a confirmation that the transmitted and reflected
frequencies must match the incident one). As for the spatial terms, evidently
kI· r = kR· r = kT· r, when z = 0, (9.94)
14 Nonlinear (“active”) media can change the frequency, but we are talking only about linear media.

or, more explicitly,
x(kI )x + y(kI )y = x(kR )x + y(kR )y = x(kT )x + y(kT )y , (9.95)
for all x and all y.
we get
But Eq. 9.95 can only hold if the components are separately equal, for if x = 0,
(kI )y = (kR )y = (kT )y , (9.96)
while y= 0 gives
(kI )x = (kR )x = (kT )x. (9.97)
We may as well orient our axes so that kI lies in the x z plane (i.e. (kI )y = 0);
according to Eq. 9.96, so too will kR and kT. Conclusion:
First Law: The incident, reflected, and transmitted wave vectors
form a plane (called the plane of incidence), which also includes the
normal to the surface (here, the z axis).
Meanwhile, Eq. 9.97 implies that
kI sin θI = kR sin θR = kT sin θT , (9.98)
where θI is the angle of incidence, θR is the angle of reflection, and θT is the
angle of transmission (more commonly known as the angle of refraction), all of
them measured with respect to the normal (Fig. 9.14). In view of Eq. 9.92, then,
Second Law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of
reflection,
θI = θR. (9.99)
This is the law of reflection.
As for the transmitted angle,
Third Law:
sin θT
n1
=

This is the law of refraction—Snell’s law.
These are the three fundamental laws of geometrical optics. It is remarkable
how little actual electrodynamics went into them: we have yet to invoke any spe-
cific boundary conditions—all we used was their generic form (Eq. 9.93). There-
fore, any other waves (water waves, for instance, or sound waves) can be expected
to obey the same “optical” laws when they pass from one medium into another.

These are known as Fresnel’s equations, for the case of polarization in the plane
of incidence. (There are two other Fresnel equations, giving the reflected and
transmitted amplitudes when the polarization is perpendicular to the plane of
incidence—see Prob. 9.17.) Notice that the transmitted wave is always in phase
with the incident one; the reflected wave is either in phase (“right side up”), if
α > β, or 180◦ out of phase (“upside down”), if α < β.

grazing incidence (θI = 90◦), α diverges, and the wave is totally reflected (a fact
15 There is an unavoidable ambiguity in the phase of the reflected wave, since (as I mentioned in the
footnote to Eq. 9.36) changing the sign of the polarization vector is equivalent to a 180◦ phase shift.

of the standard optics texts.

that is painfully familiar to anyone who has driven at night on a wet road). Inter-
estingly, there is an intermediate angle, θB (called Brewster’s angle), at which the
reflected wave is completely extinguished.16 According to Eq. 9.109, this occurs

naturally, it goes to zero at Brewster’s angle; T is the fraction transmitted—it
goes to 1 at θB . Note that R + T= 1, as required by conservation of energy: the

the energy per unit time leaving the patch.

9.4 ABSORPTION AND DISPERSION
9.4.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Conductors
In Sect. 9.3 I stipulated that the free charge density ρf and the free current density
J f are zero, and everything that followed was predicated on that assumption. Such
a restriction is perfectly reasonable when you’re talking about wave propagation
through a vacuum or through insulating materials such as glass or (pure) water.
But in the case of conductors we do not independently control the flow of charge,
and in general J f is certainly not zero. In fact, according to Ohm’s law, the (free)
current density in a conductor is proportional to the electric field:
J f = σE. (9.117)
With this, Maxwell’s equations for linear media assume the form

for a homogeneous linear medium, from which it follows that
ρf (t)= e−(σ/ϵ)t ρf (0). (9.120)
Thus any initial free charge ρf (0) dissipates in a characteristic time τ ≡ ϵ/σ. This
reflects the familiar fact that if you put some free charge on a conductor, it will
flow out to the edges. The time constant τ affords a measure of how “good” a con-
ductor is: For a “perfect” conductor, σ = ∞ and τ = 0; for a “good” conductor,
τ is much less than the other relevant times in the problem (in oscillatory systems,
that means τ ≪ 1/ω); for a “poor” conductor, τ is greater than the characteris-
tic times in the problem (τ ≫ 1/ω).17 But we’re not interested in this transient
17 N. Ashby, Am. J. Phys. 43, 553 (1975), points out that for good conductors τ is absurdly short
(10−19 s, for copper, whereas the time between collisions is τc = 10−14 s). The problem is that Ohm’s
law itself breaks down on time scales shorter than τc ; actually, the time it takes free charge to dissipate
in a good conductor is of order τc , not τ. Moreover, H. C. Ohanian, Am. J. Phys. 51, 1020 (1983),
shows that it takes even longer for the fields and currents to equilibrate. But none of this is relevant
to our present purpose; the net free charge density in a conductor does quickly dissipate, and exactly
how long the process takes is beside the point.

These differ from the corresponding equations for nonconducting media (Eq. 9.67)

9.4.2 Reflection at a Conducting Surface
The boundary conditions we used to analyze reflection and refraction at an in-
terface between two dielectrics do not hold in the presence of free charges and
currents. Instead, we have the more general relations (Eq. 7.64):

(9.139)
where σf (not to be confused with conductivity) is the free surface charge, K f
is the free surface current, andˆ
n (not to be confused with the polarization of the
wave) is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface, pointing from medium (2)
into medium (1). For ohmic conductors (J f = σE) there can be no free surface
current, since this would require an infinite electric field at the boundary.
Suppose now that the x y plane forms the boundary between a nonconducting
linear medium (1) and a conductor (2). A monochromatic plane wave, traveling
in the z direction and polarized in the x direction, approaches from the left, as in

At z = 0, the combined wave in medium (1) must join the wave in medium

In this case the wave is totally reflected, with a 180◦ phase shift. (That’s why
excellent conductors make good mirrors. In practice, you paint a thin coating of
silver onto the back of a pane of glass—the glass has nothing to do with the
reflection; it’s just there to support the silver and to keep it from tarnishing. Since
the skin depth in silver at optical frequencies is less than 100 Å, you don’t need a
very thick layer.)
Problem 9.22 Calculate the reflection coefficient for light at an air-to-silver inter-
face (μ1 = μ2 = μ0, ϵ1 = ϵ0, σ = 6 × 107(· m)−1), at optical frequencies (ω =
4 × 1015/s).
9.4.3 The Frequency Dependence of Permittivity
In the preceding sections, we have seen that the propagation of electromagnetic
waves through matter is governed by three properties of the material: the permit-
tivity ϵ, the permeability μ, and the conductivity σ. Actually, each of these param-
eters depends to some extent on the frequency of the waves you are considering.
Indeed, it is well known from optics that n
∼
= √ϵr is a function of wavelength
(Fig. 9.19 shows the graph for a typical glass). A prism or a raindrop bends blue
light more sharply than red, and spreads white light out into a rainbow of colors.
This phenomenon is called dispersion. By extension, whenever the speed of a
wave depends on its frequency, the supporting medium is called dispersive.

Because waves of different frequency travel at different speeds in a dispersive
medium, a wave form that incorporates a range of frequencies will change shape
as it propagates. A sharply peaked wave typically flattens out, and whereas each
sinusoidal component travels at the ordinary wave (or phase) velocity,
ω
v =
k, (9.149)
the packet as a whole (the “envelope”) moves at the so-called group velocity18
vg =
dω
dk. (9.150)
[You can demonstrate this by dropping a rock into the nearest pond and watching
the waves that form: While the disturbance as a whole spreads out in a circle,
moving at speed vg , the ripples that go to make it up will be seen to travel twice
as fast (v = 2vg in this case). They appear at the back end of the packet, growing
as they move forward to the center, then shrinking again and fading away at the
front (Fig. 9.20).] We shall not concern ourselves with these matters—I’ll stick
to monochromatic waves, for which the problem does not arise. But I should
just mention that the energy carried by a wave packet in a dispersive medium
does not travel at the phase velocity. Don’t be too alarmed, therefore, if in some
circumstances v comes out greater than c.

18 See A. P. French, Vibrations and Waves (New York: W. W. Norton & Co., 1971), p. 230, or F. S.
Crawford, Jr., Waves (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1968), Sect. 6.2.
19 Even the group velocity can exceed c in special cases—see P. C. Peters, Am. J. Phys. 56, 129 (1988),
or work Prob. 9.26. For delightful commentary, see C. F. Bohren, Am. J. Phys. 77, 101 (2009). And if
two different “speeds of light” are not enough to satisfy you, check out S. C. Bloch, Am. J. Phys. 45,
538 (1977), in which no fewer than eight distinct velocities are identified! Indeed, it’s not clear what
you mean by the “velocity” of something that changes shape as it moves, and has no precise beginning
or end. Do you mean the speed at which the peak intensity propagates? Or the speed at which energy
is transported? Or information transmitted? In special relativity no causal signal can travel faster than
c, but some of the other “velocities” have no such restriction.
9.4 Absorption and Dispersion 419

FIGURE 9.20
My purpose in this section is to account for the frequency dependence of ϵ
in dielectrics, using a simplified model for the behavior of the electrons. Like all
classical models of atomic-scale phenomena, it is at best an approximation to the
truth; nevertheless, it does yield qualitatively satisfactory results, and it provides
a plausible mechanism for dispersion in transparent media.
The electrons in a nonconductor are bound to specific molecules. The actual
binding forces can be quite complicated, but we shall picture each electron as
attached to the end of a spring, with force constant kspring (Fig. 9.21):
Fbinding = −kspring x = −mω2
0 x, (9.151)
where x is displacement from equilibrium, m is the electron’s mass, and ω0 is
the natural oscillation frequency, kspring/m. [If this strikes you as an implausible
model, look back at Ex. 4.1, where we were led to a force of precisely this form.
As a matter of fact, practically any binding force can be approximated this way for
sufficiently small displacements from equilibrium, as you can see by expanding
the potential energy in a Taylor series about the equilibrium point:
U (x)= U (0) + xU ′(0) +
1
2
x2U ′′(0) + ···.
The first term is a constant, with no dynamical significance (you can always adjust
the zero of potential energy so that U (0)= 0). The second term automatically
vanishes, since dU/d x= −F, and by the nature of an equilibrium, the force at
that point is zero. The third term is precisely the potential energy of a spring with
force constant kspring = d2U/d x2
0 (the second derivative is positive, for a point
of stable equilibrium). As long as the displacements are small, the higher terms in
the series can be neglected. Geometrically, all I am saying is that practically any
function can be fit near a minimum by a suitable parabola.]

Meanwhile, there will presumably be some damping force on the electron:
d x
Fdamping = −mγ
dt. (9.152)
[Again I have chosen the simplest possible form; the damping must be opposite in
direction to the velocity, and making it proportional to the velocity is the easiest
way to accomplish this. The cause of the damping does not concern us here—
among other things, an oscillating charge radiates, and the radiation siphons off
energy. We will calculate this “radiation damping” in Chapter 11.]
In the presence of an electromagnetic wave of frequency ω, polarized in the x
direction (Fig. 9.21), the electron is subject to a driving force
Fdriving = q E= q E0 cos(ωt), (9.153)
where q is the charge of the electron and E0 is the amplitude of the wave at the
point z where the electron is situated. (Since we’re only interested in one point, I
have reset the clock so that the maximum E occurs there at t = 0. For simplicity,
I assume the magnetic force is negligible.) Putting all this into Newton’s second
law gives

dt2
or
m
d2 x
dt2 + mγ
d x

0 x = q E0 cos(ωt). (9.154)
Our model, then, describes the electron as a damped harmonic oscillator, driven
at frequency ω. (The much more massive nucleus remains at rest.)

equation:

The imaginary term in the denominator means that p is out of phase with E—
lagging behind by an angle tan−1[γω/(ω2
0− ω2)] that is very small when ω ≪ ω0
and rises to π when ω ≫ ω0.
In general, differently situated electrons within a given molecule experience
different natural frequencies and damping coefficients. Let’s say there are f j
electrons with frequency ωj and damping γj in each molecule. If there are N
molecules per unit volume, the polarization P is given by20 the real part of

Now, I defined the electric susceptibility as the proportionality constant between
P and E (specifically, P= ϵ0χeE). In the present case, P is not proportional to E
(this is not, strictly speaking, a linear medium) because of the difference in phase.
However, the complex polarization˜
P is proportional to the complex field˜
E, and
this suggests that we introduce a complex susceptibility,
˜
χe:

the real part of˜
E. In particular, the proportionality between˜
D and˜

20This applies directly to the case of a dilute gas; for denser materials the theory is modified slightly,
in accordance with the Clausius-Mossotti equation (Prob. 4.41). By the way, don’t confuse the “polar-
ization” of a medium, P, with the “polarization” of a wave—same word, but two completely unrelated
meanings.

The wave is attenuated (this is hardly surprising, since the damping absorbs
energy). Because the intensity is proportional to E2 (and hence to e−2κz ), the
quantity
α ≡ 2κ (9.167)
is called the absorption coefficient. Meanwhile, the wave velocity is ω/k, and
the index of refraction is

I have deliberately used notation reminiscent of Sect. 9.4.1. However, in the
present case k and κ have nothing to do with conductivity; rather, they are deter-
mined by the parameters of our damped harmonic oscillator. For gases, the second
term in Eq. 9.161 is small, and we can approximate the square root (Eq. 9.164) by

In Fig. 9.22 I have plotted the index of refraction and the absorption coefficient
in the vicinity of one of the resonances. Most of the time the index of refraction
rises gradually with increasing frequency, consistent with our experience from
optics (Fig. 9.19). However, in the immediate neighborhood of a resonance the
index of refraction drops sharply. Because this behavior is atypical, it is called

anomalous dispersion. Notice that the region of anomalous dispersion (ω1 <
ω < ω2, in the figure) coincides with the region of maximum absorption; in fact,
the material may be practically opaque in this frequency range. The reason is that
we are now driving the electrons at their “favorite” frequency; the amplitude of
their oscillation is relatively large, and a correspondingly large amount of energy
is dissipated by the damping mechanism.
In Fig. 9.22, n runs below 1 above the resonance, suggesting that the wave
speed exceeds c. As I mentioned earlier, this is no immediate cause for alarm,
since energy does not travel at the wave velocity. Moreover, the graph does not
include the contributions of other terms in the sum, which add a relatively con-
stant “background” that, in some cases, keeps n > 1 on both sides of the reso-
nance. Incidentally, the group velocity can also exceed c in the neighborhood of a
resonance, in this model (see Prob. 9.26).
If you agree to stay away from the resonances, the damping can be ignored,
and the formula for the index of refraction simplifies:

Or, in terms of the wavelength in vacuum (λ= 2πc/ω):

This is known as Cauchy’s formula; the constant A is called the coefficient of re-
fraction, and B is called the coefficient of dispersion. Cauchy’s equation applies
reasonably well to most gases, in the optical region.
What I have described in this section is certainly not the complete story of dis-
persion in nonconducting media. Nevertheless, it does indicate how the damped
harmonic motion of electrons can account for the frequency dependence of the in-
dex of refraction, and it explains why n is ordinarily a slowly increasing function
of ω, with occasional “anomalous” regions where it precipitously drops.
Problem 9.23
(a) Shallow water is nondispersive; waves travel at a speed that is proportional to
the square root of the depth. In deep water, however, the waves can’t “feel”
all the way down to the bottom—they behave as though the depth were pro-
portional to λ. (Actually, the distinction between “shallow” and “deep” itself
depends on the wavelength: If the depth is less than λ, the water is “shallow”;
if it is substantially greater than λ, the water is “deep.”) Show that the wave
velocity of deep water waves is twice the group velocity.
(b) In quantum mechanics, a free particle of mass m traveling in the x direction is
described by the wave function
(x,t)= Aei (px−Et)/¯ h
,
where p is the momentum, and E= p2/2m is the kinetic energy. Calculate the
group velocity and the wave velocity. Which one corresponds to the classical
speed of the particle? Note that the wave velocity is half the group velocity.
Problem 9.24 If you take the model in Ex. 4.1 at face value, what natural frequency
do you get? Put in the actual numbers. Where, in the electromagnetic spectrum, does
this lie, assuming the radius of the atom is 0.5 Å? Find the coefficients of refraction
and dispersion, and compare them with the measured values for hydrogen at 0◦C
and atmospheric pressure: A= 1.36 × 10−4
, B= 7.7 × 10−15m2
.
Problem 9.25 Find the width of the anomalous dispersion region for the case of
a single resonance at frequency ω0. Assume γ ≪ ω0. Show that the index of re-
fraction assumes its maximum and minimum values at points where the absorption
coefficient is at half-maximum.
Problem 9.26 Starting with Eq. 9.170, calculate the group velocity, assuming there
is only one resonance, at ω0. Use a computer to graph y ≡ vg /c as a function
of x ≡ (ω/ω0)2, from x = 0 to 2, (a) for γ= 0, and (b) for γ= (0.1)ω0. Let
(N q2)/(2mϵ0ω2
0 )= 0.003. Note that the group velocity can exceed c.
9.5 Guided Waves 425
9.5 GUIDED WAVES
9.5.1 Wave Guides
So far, we have dealt with plane waves of infinite extent; now we consider elec-
tromagnetic waves confined to the interior of a hollow pipe, or wave guide
(Fig. 9.23). We’ll assume the wave guide is a perfect conductor, so that E= 0
and B= 0 inside the material itself, and hence the boundary conditions at the
inner wall are21
(i) E∥ = 0,
(ii) B⊥
= 0.
(9.175)
Free charges and currents22 will be induced on the surface in such a way as to
enforce these constraints. We are interested in monochromatic waves that propa-
gate down the tube, so E and B have the generic form
(i)

E(x, y, z,t)=

(ii)
B(x, y, z,t)=
˜
E0(x, y)ei (kz−ωt)
,
˜
B0(x, y)ei (kz−ωt)
.
(9.176)
(For the cases of interest, k is real, so I shall dispense with its tilde.) The electric
and magnetic fields must, of course, satisfy Maxwell’s equations, in the interior
of the wave guide:
x

FIGURE 9.23
21 See Eq. 9.139 and Prob. 7.44. In a perfect conductor, E= 0, and hence (by Faraday’s law)
∂B/∂t = 0; assuming the magnetic field started out zero, then, it will remain so.
22 In Section 9.4.2 I argued that there can be no surface currents in an ohmic conductor (with finite
conductivity). But there are volume currents, extending in (roughly) to the skin depth. As the con-
ductivity increases, they are squeezed into a thinner and thinner layer, and in the limit of a perfect
conductor they become true surface currents.

If Ez = 0, we call these TE (“transverse electric”) waves; if Bz = 0, they are
called TM (“transverse magnetic”) waves; if both Ez = 0 and Bz = 0, we call
them TEM waves.
24 It turns out that TEM waves cannot occur in a hollow wave
guide.
Proof. If Ez = 0, Gauss’s law (Eq. 9.177i) says

Indeed, the vector˜
E0 in Eq. 9.178 has zero divergence and zero curl. It can there-
fore be written as the gradient of a scalar potential that satisfies Laplace’s equa-
tion. But the boundary condition on E (Eq. 9.175) requires that the surface be an
equipotential, and since Laplace’s equation admits no local maxima or minima
(Sect. 3.1.4), this means that the potential is constant throughout, and hence the
electric field is zero—no wave at all.
Notice that this argument applies only to a completely empty pipe—if you run a
separate conductor down the middle, the potential at its surface need not be the
same as on the outer wall, and hence a nontrivial potential is possible. We’ll see
an example of this in Sect. 9.5.3.

(b) Put Eq. 9.180 into Maxwell’s equations (i) and (ii) to obtain Eq. 9.181. Check
that you get the same results using (i) and (iv) of Eq. 9.179.
24 In the case of TEM waves (including the unconfined plane waves of Sect. 9.2), k= ω/c, Eqs. 9.180
are indeterminate, and you have to go back to Eqs. 9.179.

TE Waves in a Rectangular Wave Guide
Suppose we have a wave guide of rectangular shape (Fig. 9.24), with height a
and width b, and we are interested in the propagation of TE waves. The problem
is to solve Eq. 9.181ii, subject to the boundary condition 9.175ii. We’ll do it by
separation of variables. Let
Bz (x, y)= X (x)Y (y),
so that
Y
d2 X
d x2 + X
d2Y
d y2 + (ω/c)2
− k2 X Y= 0.
Divide by X Y , and note that the x- and y-dependent terms must be constants:

y + (ω/c)2

= 0. (9.183)
The general solution to Eq. 9.182i is
X (x)= A sin (kx x) + B cos (kx x).
But the boundary conditions require that Bx —and hence also (Eq. 9.180iii)
d X/d x—vanishes at x = 0 and x = a. So A= 0, and
kx = mπ/a, (m = 0,1,2,... ). (9.184)
The same goes for Y , with
ky = nπ/b, (n = 0,1,2,... ), (9.185)

FIGURE 9.24
9.5 Guided Waves 429
and we conclude that
Bz = B0 cos (mπx/a) cos (nπy/b). (9.186)
This solution is called the TEmn mode. (The first index is conventionally asso-
ciated with the larger dimension, so we assume a ≥ b. By the way, at least one of
the indices must be nonzero—see Prob. 9.28.) The wave number (k) is obtained
by putting Eqs. 9.184 and 9.185 into Eq. 9.183:
k= (ω/c)2
− π2[(m/a)2 + (n/b)2]. (9.187)
If
ω < cπ (m/a)2 + (n/b)2 ≡ ωmn , (9.188)
the wave number is imaginary, and instead of a traveling wave we have expo-
nentially attenuated fields (Eq. 9.176). For this reason, ωmn is called the cutoff
frequency for the mode in question. The lowest cutoff frequency for a given wave
guide occurs for the mode TE10:
ω10 = cπ/a. (9.189)
Frequencies less than this will not propagate at all.
The wave number can be written more simply in terms of the cutoff frequency:
k=
1
c
ω2
− ω2
mn. (9.190)
The wave velocity is
v =
1
ω
k=
c
1− (ωmn /ω)2 , (9.191)
which is greater than c. However (see Prob. 9.30), the energy carried by the wave
travels at the group velocity (Eq. 9.150):
vg =
dk/dω
= c 1− (ωmn /ω)2 < c. (9.192)
There’s another way to visualize the propagation of an electromagnetic wave
in a rectangular pipe, and it serves to illuminate many of these results. Con-
sider an ordinary plane wave, traveling at an angle θ to the z axis, and reflect-
ing perfectly off each conducting surface (Fig. 9.25). In the x and y directions,
the (multiply reflected) waves interfere to form standing wave patterns, of wave-
length λx = 2a/m and λy = 2b/n (hence wave number kx = 2π/λx = πm/a
and ky = πn/b), respectively. Meanwhile, in the z direction there remains a trav-
eling wave, with wave number kz = k. The propagation vector for the “original”
plane wave is therefore

and the frequency is
ω = c|k′| = c k2 + π2[(m/a)2 + (n/b)2] = (ck)2 + (ωmn )2
.
Only certain angles will lead to one of the allowed standing wave patterns:
cos θ=

|k′|

The plane wave travels at speed c, but because it is going at an angle θ to the
z axis, its net velocity down the wave guide is
vg = c cos θ= c 1− (ωmn /ω)2
.
The wave velocity, on the other hand, is the speed of the wave fronts ( A, say, in
Fig. 9.25) down the pipe. Like the intersection of a line of breakers with the beach,
they can move much faster than the waves themselves—in fact

Problem 9.28 Show that the mode TE00 cannot occur in a rectangular wave guide.

to Eq. 9.179. Show that Bz is a constant, and hence—applying Faraday’s law in
integral form to a cross section—that Bz = 0, so this would be a TEM mode.]
Problem 9.29 Consider a rectangular wave guide with dimensions 2.28 cm ×
1.01 cm. What TE modes will propagate in this wave guide, if the driving fre-
quency is 1.70 × 1010 Hz? Suppose you wanted to excite only one TE mode; what
range of frequencies could you use? What are the corresponding wavelengths (in
open space)?
Problem 9.30 Confirm that the energy in the TEmn mode travels at the group veloc-
ity. [Hint: Find the time averaged Poynting vector ⟨S⟩ and the energy density ⟨u⟩
(use Prob. 9.12 if you wish). Integrate over the cross section of the wave guide to

ratio.]

mode?]
9.5.3 The Coaxial Transmission Line
In Sect. 9.5.1, I showed that a hollow wave guide cannot support TEM waves.
But a coaxial transmission line, consisting of a long straight wire of radius a,
surrounded by a cylindrical conducting sheath of radius b (Fig. 9.26), does admit
modes with Ez = 0 and Bz = 0. In this case Maxwell’s equations (Eq. 9.179)
yield
k= ω/c (9.193)
(so the waves travel at speed c, and are nondispersive),
c By = Ex and c Bx = −Ey (9.194)

there is no refracted ray at all, only a reflected one (this is the phenomenon of total
internal reflection, on which light pipes and fiber optics are based). But the fields

Given ρ(r,t) and J(r,t), what are the fields E(r,t) and B(r,t)? In the static case,
Coulomb’s law and the Biot-Savart law provide the answer. What we’re looking
for, then, is the generalization of those laws to time-dependent configurations.
This is not an easy problem, and it pays to begin by representing the fields
in terms of potentials. In electrostatics ∇ × E= 0 allowed us to write E as the
gradient of a scalar potential: E= −∇V . In electrodynamics this is no longer
possible, because the curl of E is nonzero. But B remains divergenceless, so we
can still write

10.1.2 Gauge Transformations
Equations 10.4 and 10.5 are ugly, and you might be inclined to abandon the
potential formulation altogether. However, we have succeeded in reducing six
problems—finding E and B (three components each)—down to four: V (one com-
ponent) and A (three more). Moreover, Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3 do not uniquely define
the potentials; we are free to impose extra conditions on V and A, as long as
nothing happens to E and B. Let’s work out precisely what this gauge freedom
entails.
Suppose we have two sets of potentials, (V ,A) and (V ′
,A′), which correspond
to the same electric and magnetic fields. By how much can they differ? Write
A′
= A + α α α and V ′
= V + β.
Since the two A’s give the same B, their curls must be equal, and hence
∇ × α α α = 0.
We can therefore write α α α as the gradient of some scalar:
α α α = ∇λ.
The two potentials also give the same E, so
∂α α α
∇β +
= 0,
∂t
440 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields
or
∇ β +
∂λ
∂t
= 0.
The term in parentheses is therefore independent of position (it could, however,
depend on time); call it k(t):
∂λ
β= −
+ k(t).
∂t
Actually, we might as well absorb k(t) into λ, defining a new λ by adding
t
0 k(t′)dt′ to the old one. This will not affect the gradient of λ; it just adds k(t) to
∂λ/∂t. It follows that
A′
= A + ∇λ,
∂λ
V ′
= V−
∂t.
⎫ ⎬ ⎭
(10.7)
Conclusion: For any old scalar function λ(r,t), we can with impunity add ∇λ
to A, provided we simultaneously subtract ∂λ/∂t from V . This will not affect the
physical quantities E and B. Such changes in V and A are called gauge trans-
formations. They can be exploited to adjust the divergence of A, with a view
to simplifying the “ugly” equations 10.4 and 10.5. In magnetostatics, it was best
to choose ∇· A= 0 (Eq. 5.63); in electrodynamics, the situation is not so clear
cut, and the most convenient gauge depends to some extent on the problem at
hand. There are many famous gauges in the literature; I’ll show you the two most
popular ones.

10.1.3 Coulomb Gauge and Lorenz Gauge
The Coulomb Gauge. As in magnetostatics, we pick
∇· A= 0. (10.8)
With this, Eq. 10.4 becomes

∇2 V= −
ρ. (10.9)

r
There is a very peculiar thing about the scalar potential in the Coulomb gauge:
it is determined by the distribution of charge right now. If I move an electron
in my laboratory, the potential V on the moon immediately records this change.
That sounds particularly odd in the light of special relativity, which allows no
message to travel faster than c. The point is that V by itself is not a physically
measurable quantity—all the man in the moon can measure is E, and that involves
A as well (Eq. 10.3). Somehow it is built into the vector potential (in the Coulomb
gauge) that whereas V instantaneously reflects all changes in ρ, the combination
−∇V− (∂A/∂t) does not; E will change only after sufficient time has elapsed
for the “news” to arrive.1
The advantage of the Coulomb gauge is that the scalar potential is particu-
larly simple to calculate; the disadvantage (apart from the acausal appearance of
V ) is that A is particularly difficult to calculate. The differential equation for A
(Eq. 10.5) in the Coulomb gauge reads
∂2A
∇2A− μ0ϵ0
∂t2
= −μ0J + μ0ϵ0∇
∂V
∂t. (10.11)
The Lorenz gauge. In the Lorenz2 gauge, we pick
∂V
∇· A= −μ0ϵ0
∂t. (10.12)
This is designed to eliminate the middle term in Eq. 10.5 (in the language of
Prob. 10.1, it sets L= 0). With this,
∂2A
∇2A− μ0ϵ0
= −μ0J. (10.13)
Meanwhile, the differential equation for V, (Eq. 10.4), becomes
1
∇2 V− μ0ϵ0
= −
ρ. (10.14)
∂t2
The virtue of the Lorenz gauge is that it treats V and A on an equal footing:

(called the d’Alembertian) occurs in both equations:

(10.16)
(ii) 2A= −μ0J.
This democratic treatment of V and A is especially nice in the context of special
relativity, where the d’Alembertian is the natural generalization of the Laplacian,
and Eqs. 10.16 can be regarded as four-dimensional versions of Poisson’s equa-
tion. In this same spirit, the wave equation 2 f= 0, might be regarded as the
four-dimensional version of Laplace’s equation. In the Lorenz gauge, V and A
satisfy the inhomogeneous wave equation, with a “source” term (in place of
zero) on the right. From now on, I shall use the Lorenz gauge exclusively, and the
whole of electrodynamics reduces to the problem of solving the inhomogeneous
wave equation for a specified source.
Problem 10.5 Which of the potentials in Ex. 10.1, Prob. 10.3, and Prob. 10.4 are in
the Coulomb gauge? Which are in the Lorenz gauge? (Notice that these gauges are
not mutually exclusive.)
Problem 10.6 In Chapter 5, I showed that it is always possible to pick a vector
potential whose divergence is zero (the Coulomb gauge). Show that it is always
possible to choose ∇· A= −μ0ϵ0(∂V /∂t), as required for the Lorenz gauge, as-
suming you know how to solve the inhomogeneous wave equation (Eq. 10.16). Is it
always possible to pick V= 0? How about A= 0?

10.1.4 Lorentz Force Law in Potential Form4
It is illuminating to express the Lorentz force law in terms of potentials:
dp
F=
dt= q(E + v × B)= q−∇V−
∂A
+ v × (∇ × A) , (10.17)
3P. R. Berman, Am. J. Phys. 76 48 (2008).
4This section can be skipped without loss of continuity.
∂t
10.1 The Potential Formulation 443
where p= mv is the momentum of the particle. Now, product rule 4 says
∇(v· A)= v × (∇ × A) + (v· ∇)A
(v, the velocity of the particle, is a function of time, but not of position). Thus
dp
dt= −q
∂A
∂t
+ (v· ∇)A + ∇(V− v· A) . (10.18)
The combination
∂t
+ (v· ∇)A
is called the convective derivative of A, and written dA/dt (total derivative). It
represents the time rate of change of A at the (moving) location of the particle.
For suppose that at time t the particle is at point r, where the potential is A(r,t);
a moment dt later it is at r + v dt, where the potential is A(r + v dt,t + dt). The
change in A, then, is
dA= A(r + v dt,t + dt)− A(r,t)
=
∂A
∂x
(vx dt) +
∂A
∂y
(vy dt) +
∂A

(vz dt) +
∂A
∂t
dt,
∂A
so
∂A
dA
dt=
+ (v· ∇)A. (10.19)
∂t
As the particle moves, the potential it “feels” changes for two distinct reasons:
first, because the potential varies with time, and second, because it is now in a
new location, where A is different because of its variation in space. Hence the
two terms in Eq. 10.19.
With the aid of the convective derivative, the Lorentz force law reads:
d
dt (p + qA)= −∇ q(V− v· A) . (10.20)
This is reminiscent of the standard formula from mechanics, for the motion of a
particle whose potential energy U is a specified function of position:
dp
dt= −∇U.
Playing the role of p is the so-called canonical momentum,
pcan = p + qA, (10.21)
while the part of U is taken by the velocity-dependent quantity
Uvel = q(V− v· A). (10.22)
444 Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields
A similar argument (Prob. 10.9) gives the rate of change of the particle’s
energy:
∂
d
dt (T + q V )=
[q(V− v· A)], (10.23)
∂t
where T=
1
2 mv2 is its kinetic energy and q V is its potential energy (The deriva-
tive on the right acts only on V and A, not on v). Curiously, the same quantity5
Uvel appears on the right side of both equations. The parallel between Eq. 10.20
and Eq. 10.23 invites us to interpret A as a kind of “potential momentum” per unit
charge, just as V is potential energy per unit charge.6
Problem 10.8 The vector potential for a uniform magnetostatic field is A=−

(r×B) (Prob. 5.25). Show that dA/dt= −
1
2 (v × B), in this case, and confirm that
Eq. 10.20 yields the correct equation of motion.
Problem 10.9 Derive Eq. 10.23. [Hint: Start by dotting v into Eq. 10.17.]
10.2 CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS

6There are other arguments for this interpretation, which Maxwell himself favored, and many modern
authors advocate. For a fascinating discussion, see M. D. Semon and J. R. Taylor, Am. J. Phys. 64, 1361
(1996). Incidentally, it is the canonical angular momentum (derived from pcan), not the mechanical
portion alone, that is quantized—see R. H. Young, Am. J. Phys. 66, 1043 (1998).

10.2 Continuous Distributions 445
where r, as always, is the distance from the source point r′ to the field point r
(Fig. 10.3). Now, electromagnetic “news” travels at the speed of light. In the non-
static case, therefore, it’s not the status of the source right now that matters, but
rather its condition at some earlier time tr (called the retarded time) when the
“message” left. Since this message must travel a distance r, the delay is r/c:
r
tr ≡ t−
c. (10.25)
The natural generalization of Eq. 10.24 for nonstatic sources is therefore
V (r,t)=
1
4πϵ0
ρ(r′
,tr )
μ0
4π
J(r′
,tr )
Here ρ(r′
,tr ) is the charge density that prevailed at point r′ at the retarded time
tr . Because the integrands are evaluated at the retarded time, these are called re-
tarded potentials. (I speak of “the” retarded time, but of course the more distant
parts of the charge distribution have earlier retarded times than nearby ones. It’s
just like the night sky: The light we see now left each star at the retarded time cor-
responding to that star’s distance from the earth.) Note that the retarded potentials
reduce properly to Eq. 10.24 in the static case, for which ρ and J are independent
of time.
Well, that all sounds reasonable—and surprisingly simple. But are we sure it’s
right? I didn’t actually derive the formulas for V and A (Eq. 10.26); all I did
was invoke a heuristic argument (“electromagnetic news travels at the speed of
light”) to make them seem plausible. To prove them, I must show that they satisfy
the inhomogeneous wave equation (Eq. 10.16) and meet the Lorenz condition
(Eq. 10.12). In case you think I’m being fussy, let me warn you that if you apply
the same logic to the fields you’ll get entirely the wrong answer:
E(r,t) ̸=

Let’s stop and check, then, that the retarded scalar potential satisfies Eq. 10.16;
essentially the same argument would serve for the vector potential.7 I shall leave
it for you (Prob. 10.10) to show that the retarded potentials obey the Lorenz
condition.
In calculating the Laplacian of V (r,t), the crucial point to notice is that the
integrand (in Eq. 10.26) depends on r in two places: explicitly, in the denominator
(r = |r− r′|), and implicitly, through tr = t− r/c, in the numerator. Thus

A few signs are changed, but the final result is unaffected. Although the advanced
potentials are entirely consistent with Maxwell’s equations, they violate the most
sacred tenet in all of physics: the principle of causality. They suggest that the po-
tentials now depend on what the charge and the current distribution will be at some

advanced potentials are of some theoretical interest, they have no direct physical
significance.9

9Because the d’Alembertian involves t2 (as opposed to t), the theory itself is time-reversal invariant,

electromagnetic influences propagate forward, not backward, in time.

Equations 10.36 and 10.38 are the (causal) solutions to Maxwell’s equations.
For some reason, they do not seem to have been published until quite recently—
the earliest explicit statement of which I am aware was by Oleg Jefimenko, in
1966.10 In practice Jefimenko’s equations are of limited utility, since it is typi-
cally easier to calculate the retarded potentials and differentiate them, rather than
going directly to the fields. Nevertheless, they provide a satisfying sense of clo-
sure to the theory. They also help to clarify an observation I made in the previous
section: To get to the retarded potentials, all you do is replace t by tr in the elec-
trostatic and magnetostatic formulas, but in the case of the fields not only is time
replaced by retarded time, but completely new terms (involving derivatives of ρ
and J) appear. And they provide surprisingly strong support for the quasistatic
approximation (see Prob. 10.14).

10.3 Point Charges 451
That is: the Biot-Savart law holds, with J evaluated at the non-retarded time. This
means that the quasistatic approximation is actually much better than we had any
right to expect: the two errors involved (neglecting retardation and dropping the
second term in Eq. 10.38) cancel one another, to first order.
10.3 POINT CHARGES
10.3.1 Liénard-Wiechert Potentials
My next project is to calculate the (retarded) potentials, V (r,t) and A(r,t), of a
point charge q that is moving on a specified trajectory
w(t) ≡ position of q at time t. (10.39)
A naïve reading of the formula (Eq. 10.26)
1
V (r,t)=
4πϵ0
might suggest to you that the potential is simply
1
q
dτ′ (10.40)
ρ(r′
,tr )
r
r
4πϵ0
(the same as in the static case, with the understanding that r is the distance to the
retarded position of the charge). But this is wrong, for a very subtle reason: It is
true that for a point source the denominator r comes outside the integral,11 but
what remains,
ρ(r′
,tr )dτ′
, (10.41)
is not equal to the charge of the particle (and depends, through tr , on the location
of the point r). To calculate the total charge of a configuration, you must inte-
grate ρ over the entire distribution at one instant of time, but here the retardation,
tr = t− r/c, obliges us to evaluate ρ at different times for different parts of the
configuration. If the source is moving, this will give a distorted picture of the total
charge. You might think that this problem would disappear for point charges, but
it doesn’t. In Maxwell’s electrodynamics, formulated as it is in terms of charge
and current densities, a point charge must be regarded as the limit of an extended
charge, when the size goes to zero. And for an extended particle, no matter how
small, the retardation in Eq. 10.41 throws in a factor (1−

r· v/c)−1, where v is
the velocity of the charge at the retarded time:
ρ(r′
,tr )dτ′
=
1−
q
ˆ
r· v/c. (10.42)
11There is, however, an implicit change in its functional dependence: Before the integration,
r = |r− r′| is a function of r and r′; after the integration, which fixes r′
= w(tr ), r = |r− w(tr )|
is (like tr ) a function of r and t.

Proof. This is a purely geometrical effect, and it may help to tell the story in a
less abstract context. You will not have noticed it, for obvious reasons, but the fact
is that a train coming towards you looks a little longer than it really is, because
the light you receive from the caboose left earlier than the light you receive si-
multaneously from the engine, and at that earlier time the train was farther away
(Fig. 10.6). In the interval it takes light from the caboose to travel the extra dis-
tance L′, the train itself moves a distance L′

So approaching trains appear longer, by a factor (1− v/c)−1. By contrast, a train
going away from you looks shorter,
12 by a factor (1 + v/c)−1. In general, if the
train’s velocity makes an angle θ with your line of sight,13 the extra distance light
from the caboose must cover is L′ cos θ (Fig. 10.7). In the time L′ cos θ/c, then,

Notice that this effect does not distort the dimensions perpendicular to the
motion (the height and width of the train). Never mind that the light from the far
12Please note that this has nothing whatever to do with special relativity or Lorentz contraction—L is
the length of the moving train, and its rest length is not at issue. The argument is somewhat reminiscent
of the Doppler effect.

caboose and engine can be considered parallel.

no motion in that direction, they’ll still look the same distance apart. The apparent

ris a unit vector from the train to the observer.
In case the connection between moving trains and retarded potentials eludes
you, the point is this: Whenever you do an integral of the type in Eq. 10.41, in
which the integrand is evaluated at the retarded time, the effective volume is mod-
ified by the factor in Eq. 10.43, just as the apparent volume of the train was.
Because this correction factor makes no reference to the size of the particle, it is
every bit as significant for a point charge as for an extended charge.
Meanwhile, for a point charge the retarded time is determined implicitly by the
equation
|r− w(tr )| = c(t− tr ). (10.44)
The left side is the distance the “news” must travel, and (t− tr ) is the time it takes
to make the trip (Fig. 10.8); ris the vector from the retarded position to the field
point r:
r= r− w(tr ). (10.45)
It is important to note that at most one point on the trajectory is “in commu-
nication” with r at any particular time t. For suppose there were two such points,
with retarded times t1 and t2:
r1 = c(t− t1) and r2 = c(t− t2).

Then r1− r2 = c(t2− t1), so the average speed of the particle in the direction of
the point r would have to be c—and that’s not counting whatever velocity the
charge might have in other directions. Since no charged particle can travel at the
speed of light, it follows that only one retarded point contributes to the potentials,
at any given moment.

Equations 10.46 and 10.47 are the famous Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a
moving point charge.15
Example 10.3. Find the potentials of a point charge moving with constant
velocity.
Solution
For convenience, let’s say the particle passes through the origin at time t = 0, so
that
w(t)= vt.
We first compute the retarded time, using Eq. 10.44:
|r− vtr | = c(t− tr ),
14For the same reason, an observer at r sees the particle in only one place at a time. By contrast, it
is possible to hear an object in two places at once. Consider a bear who growls at you and then runs
toward you at the speed of sound and growls again; you hear both growls at the same time, coming
from two different locations, but there’s only one bear.
15There are many ways to obtain the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. I have tried to emphasize the ge-

In this case the charge is at rest at the origin, and the retarded time should be

Problem 10.17 I showed that at most one point on the particle trajectory commu-
nicates with r at any given time. In some cases there may be no such point (an
observer at r would not see the particle—in the colorful language of general rela-
tivity, it is “over the horizon”). As an example, consider a particle in hyperbolic
motion along the x axis:
w(t)= b2 + (ct)2ˆ
x (−∞ < t < ∞). (10.52)
(In special relativity, this is the trajectory of a particle subject to a constant force
F= mc2/b.) Sketch the graph of w versus t. At four or five representative points
on the curve, draw the trajectory of a light signal emitted by the particle at that
point—both in the plus x direction and in the minus x direction. What region on
your graph corresponds to points and times (x,t) from which the particle cannot
be seen? At what time does someone at point x first see the particle? (Prior to this
the potential at x is zero.) Is it possible for a particle, once seen, to disappear from
view?
Problem 10.18 Determine the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a charge in hyper-
bolic motion (Eq. 10.52). Assume the point r is on the x axis and to the right of the
charge.16

The Fields of a Moving Point Charge
We are now in a position to calculate the electric and magnetic fields of a point
charge in arbitrary motion, using the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:17

(rc− r· v), A(r,t)=

16The fields of a point charge in hyperbolic motion are notoriously tricky. Indeed, a straightforward
application of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials yields an electric field in violation of Gauss’s law. This
paradox was resolved by Bondi and Gold in 1955. For a history of the problem, see E. Eriksen and
Ø. Grøn, Ann. Phys. 286, 320 (2000).
17You can get the fields directly from Jefimenko’s equations, but it’s not easy. See, for example, M. A.
Heald and J. B. Marion, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation, 3d ed. (Orlando, FL: Saunders, 1995),
Sect. 8.4.

and the equations for E and B:
E= −∇V−
∂A
∂t
, B= ∇ × A.
The differentiation is tricky, however, because
r= r− w(tr ) and v =
˙
w(tr ) (10.54)
are both evaluated at the retarded time, and tr —defined implicitly by the equation
|r− w(tr )| = c(t− tr ) (10.55)
—is itself a function of r and t.
18 So hang on: the next two pages are rough going
. . . but the answer is worth the effort.
Let’s begin with the gradient of V :

(rc− r· v)2 ∇(rc− r· v). (10.56)
Since r = c(t− tr ),
19
∇r = −c∇tr. (10.57)
As for the second term, product rule 4 gives
∇(r· v)= (r· ∇)v + (v· ∇)r+ r× (∇ × v) + v × (∇ × r). (10.58)

v is the acceleration of the particle at the retarded time. Now
(v· ∇)r= (v· ∇)r− (v· ∇)w, (10.60)
18The following calculation is done by the most direct, “brute force” method. For a more clever and
efficient approach, see J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3d ed. (New York: John Wiley, 1999),
Sect. 14.1.
19Remember that r= r− w(tr ) (Fig. 10.8), and tr is itself a function of r. Contrast Prob. 1.13 (and
Section 10.2), where r= r− r′ (Fig. 10.3), and r′ was an independent variable. In that case ∇r =

Finally,

but ∇ × r = 0, while, by the same argument as Eq. 10.62,
∇ × w = −v × ∇tr. (10.64)
Putting all this back into Eq. 10.58, and using the “BAC-CAB” rule to reduce the
triple cross products,
∇(r· v)= a(r· ∇tr ) + v− v(v· ∇tr )− r× (a × ∇tr ) + v × (v × ∇tr )
= v + (r· a− v2)∇tr. (10.65)

(rc− r· v)2 v + (c2

To complete the calculation, we need to know ∇tr . This can be found by taking
the gradient of the defining equation (Eq. 10.55)—which we have already done in
Eq. 10.57—and expanding ∇r:
−c∇tr = ∇r = ∇√r· r=

But
(r· ∇)r= r− v(r· ∇tr )
(same idea as Eq. 10.60), while (from Eqs. 10.63 and 10.64)
∇ × r= (v × ∇tr ).
Thus

Chapter 10 Potentials and Fields
difference is that we have v’s instead of u’s in the first two terms. In fact, since
it’s all crossed into ranyway, we can with impunity change these v’s into−u’s;
the extra term proportional to rdisappears in the cross product. It follows that
1
B(r,t)=

Evidently the magnetic field of a point charge is always perpendicular to the
electric field, and to the vector from the retarded point.
The first term in E (the one involving (c2
− v2)u) falls off as the inverse square
of the distance from the particle. If the velocity and acceleration are both zero, this
term alone survives and reduces to the old electrostatic result
E=

For this reason, the first term in E is sometimes called the generalized Coulomb
field. (Because it does not depend on the acceleration, it is also known as the
velocity field.) The second term (the one involving r× (u × a)) falls off as the
inverse first power of r and is therefore dominant at large distances. As we shall
see in Chapter 11, it is this term that is responsible for electromagnetic radiation;
accordingly, it is called the radiation field—or, since it is proportional to a, the
acceleration field. The same terminology applies to the magnetic field.
Back in Chapter 2, I commented that if we could write down the formula for
the force one charge exerts on another, we would be done with electrodynamics, in
principle. That, together with the superposition principle, would tell us the force
exerted on a test charge Q by any configuration whatsoever. Well . . . here we are:
Eqs. 10.72 and 10.73 give us the fields, and the Lorentz force law determines the
resulting force:

where V is the velocity of Q, and r, u, v, and a are all evaluated at the retarded

tion . . . but you see why I preferred to start out with Coulomb’s law.

This is an extraordinary coincidence, since the “message” came from the retarded
position. Because of the sin2 θ in the denominator, the field of a fast-moving
charge is flattened out like a pancake in the direction perpendicular to the mo-
tion (Fig. 10.10). In the forward and backward directions E is reduced by a factor
(1− v2/c2) relative to the field of a charge at rest; in the perpendicular direction

Problem 10.29 We are now in a position to treat the example in Sect. 8.2.1 quanti-
tatively. Suppose q1 is at x1 = −vt and q2 is at y= −vt (Fig. 8.3, with t < 0). Find
the electric and magnetic forces on q1 and q2. Is Newton’s third law obeyed?
Problem 10.30 A uniformly charged rod (length L, charge density λ) slides out
the x axis at constant speed v. At time t = 0 the back end passes the origin (so
its position as a function of time is x = vt, while the front end is at x = vt + L).
Find the retarded scalar potential at the origin, as a function of time, for t > 0. [First
determine the retarded time t1 for the back end, the retarded time t2 for the front end,
and the corresponding retarded positions x1 and x2.] Is your answer consistent with
the Liénard-Wiechert potential, in the point charge limit (L ≪ vt, with λL= q)?
Do not assume v ≪ c.
Problem 10.31 A particle of charge q is traveling at constant speed v along the
x axis. Calculate the total power passing through the plane x = a, at the moment
the particle itself is at the origin. Answer: q2v/32πϵ0a2
Problem 10.3222 A particle of charge q1 is at rest at the origin. A second particle,
of charge q2, moves along the z axis at constant velocity v.
(a) Find the force F12(t) of q1 on q2, at time t (when q2 is at z = vt).
(b) Find the force F21(t) of q2 on q1, at time t. Does Newton’s third law hold, in
this case?
(c) Calculate the linear momentum p(t) in the electromagnetic fields, at time t.

them in part (d)). [Answer: (μ0q1q2/4πt)ˆ

11.1 DIPOLE RADIATION
11.1.1 What is Radiation?
When charges accelerate, their fields can transport energy irreversibly out to
infinity—a process we call radiation.
1 Let us assume the source is localized2
near the origin; we would like to calculate the energy it is radiating at time t0.
Imagine a gigantic sphere, out at radius r (Fig. 11.1) The power passing through
its surface is the integral of the Poynting vector:
P(r,t)= S· da =
1
μ0
(E × B)· da. (11.1)
Because electromagnetic “news” travels at the speed of light,3 this energy actually
left the source at the earlier time t0 = t− r/c, so the power radiated is
Prad(t0)= lim
r →∞
P r,t0 +

(11.2)

FIGURE 11.1
1In this chapter, the word “radiation” is used in a restricted technical sense—it might better be called
“radiation to infinity.” In everyday language the word has a broader connotation. We speak, for
example, of radiation from a heat lamp or an x-ray machine. In this more general sense, electromag-
netic “radiation” applies to any fields that transport energy—which is to say, fields whose Poynting
vector is non-zero. There is nothing wrong with that language, but it is not how I am using the term
here.
2For nonlocalized configurations, such as infinite planes, wires, or solenoids, the concept of “radia-
tion” must be reformulated (Prob. 11.28).
3More precisely, the fields depend on the status of the source at the retarded time.
466
11.1 Dipole Radiation 467
(with t0 held constant). This is energy (per unit time) that is carried away and
never comes back.
Now, the area of the sphere is 4πr 2, so for radiation to occur the Poynting vec-
tor must decrease (at large r ) no faster than 1/r 2 (if it went like 1/r 3, for example,
then P would go like 1/r , and Prad would be zero). According to Coulomb’s law,
electrostatic fields fall off like 1/r 2 (or even faster, if the total charge is zero), and
the Biot-Savart law says that magnetostatic fields go like 1/r 2 (or faster), which
means that S∼ 1/r 4, for static configurations. So static sources do not radiate.
But Jefimenko’s equations (Eqs. 10.36 and 10.38) indicate that time-dependent
fields include terms (involving˙
ρ and˙
J) that go like 1/r ; these are the terms that
are responsible for electromagnetic radiation.
The study of radiation, then, involves picking out the parts of E and B that go
like 1/r at large distances from the source, constructing from them the 1/r 2 term
in S, integrating over a large spherical4 surface, and taking the limit as r → ∞.
I’ll carry through this procedure first for oscillating electric and magnetic dipoles;
then, in Sect. 11.2, we’ll consider the more difficult case of radiation from an
accelerating point charge.
11.1.2 Electric Dipole Radiation
Picture two tiny metal spheres separated by a distance d and connected by a fine
wire (Fig. 11.2); at time t the charge on the upper sphere is q(t), and the charge
on the lower sphere is−q(t). Suppose that we drive the charge back and forth
through the wire, from one end to the other, at an angular frequency ω:
q(t)= q0 cos(ωt). (11.3)
The result is an oscillating electric dipole:5
p(t)= p0 cos(ωt)ˆ
z, (11.4)
where
q0 cos[ω(t− r−/c)]
r−
p0 ≡ q0d
is the maximum value of the dipole moment.
The retarded potential (Eq. 10.26) is
V (r,t)=
1
4πϵ0
q0 cos[ω(t− r+/c)]
r+−
, (11.5)
where, by the law of cosines,
r± = r 2 ∓ r d cos θ + (d/2)2
. (11.6)
4It doesn’t have to be a sphere, of course, but this makes the calculations a lot easier.
5It might occur to you that a more natural model would consist of equal and opposite charges mounted
on a spring, say, so that q is constant while d oscillates, instead of the other way around. Such a model
would lead to the same result, but moving point charges are hard to work with, and this formulation is
much simpler.

Now, to make this physical dipole into a perfect dipole, we want the separation

This is not, however, the term that concerns us now; we are interested in the fields
that survive at large distances from the source, in the so-called radiation zone:6

space. (These are actually spherical waves, not plane waves, and their amplitude
decreases like 1/r as they progress. But for large r , they are approximately plane
over small regions—just as the surface of the earth is reasonably flat, locally.)

Example 11.1. The strong frequency dependence of the power formula is what
accounts for the blueness of the sky. Sunlight passing through the atmosphere
stimulates atoms to oscillate as tiny dipoles. The incident solar radiation covers a
broad range of frequencies (white light), but the energy absorbed and reradiated
by the atmospheric dipoles is stronger at the higher frequencies because of the ω4
in Eq. 11.22. It is more intense in the blue, then, than in the red. It is this reradiated
light that you see when you look up in the sky—unless, of course, you’re staring
directly at the sun.
Because electromagnetic waves are transverse, the dipoles oscillate in a plane
orthogonal to the sun’s rays. In the celestial arc perpendicular to these rays, where

the blueness is most pronounced, the dipoles oscillating along the line of sight
send no radiation to the observer (because of the sin2 θ in equation Eq. 11.21);
light received at this angle is therefore polarized perpendicular to the sun’s rays
(Fig. 11.5).
The redness of sunset is the other side of the same coin: Sunlight coming in
at a tangent to the earth’s surface must pass through a much longer stretch of
atmosphere than sunlight coming from overhead (Fig. 11.6). Accordingly, much
of the blue has been removed by scattering, and what’s left is red.

Problem 11.3 Find the radiation resistance of the wire joining the two ends of
the dipole. (This is the resistance that would give the same average power loss—to
heat—as the oscillating dipole in fact puts out in the form of radiation.) Show that
R= 790 (d/λ)2 , where λ is the wavelength of the radiation. For the wires in an
ordinary radio (say, d= 5 cm), should you worry about the radiative contribution
to the total resistance?

vector and the intensity of the radiation. Sketch the intensity profile as a function
of the polar angle θ, and calculate the total power radiated. Does the answer seem
reasonable? (Note that power, being quadratic in the fields, does not satisfy the
superposition principle. In this instance, however, it seems to. How do you account
for this?)
11.1.3 Magnetic Dipole Radiation
Suppose now that we have a wire loop of radius b (Fig. 11.8), around which we
drive an alternating current:
I (t)= I0 cos(ωt). (11.23)

radiation to dominate. Only when the system is carefully contrived to exclude any
electric contribution (as in the case just treated) will the magnetic dipole radiation
reveal itself.

radiation resistance of the electric dipole. [Answer: 3 × 105 (b/λ)4 ]
Problem 11.7 Use the “duality” transformation of Prob. 7.64, together with the
fields of an oscillating electric dipole (Eqs. 11.18 and 11.19), to determine the fields
that would be produced by an oscillating “Gilbert” magnetic dipole (composed of
equal and opposite magnetic charges, instead of an electric current loop). Compare
Eqs. 11.36 and 11.37, and comment on the result.
Radiation from an Arbitrary Source
In the previous sections, we studied the radiation produced by two specific sys-
tems: oscillating electric dipoles and oscillating magnetic dipoles. Now I want
to apply the same procedures to a configuration of charge and current that is
entirely arbitrary, except that it is localized within some finite volume near the
origin (Fig. 11.9). The retarded scalar potential is

As before, we shall assume that the field point r is far away, in comparison to the
dimensions of the source:
approximation 1 : r ′ ≪ r. (11.45)

For an oscillating system, each of these ratios is c/ω, and we recover the old

as a procedural matter approximations 1 and 2 amount to keeping only the first-
order terms in r ′

11.1 Dipole Radiation 479
The first integral is simply the total charge, Q, at time t0. Because charge is con-
served, Q is independent of time. The other two integrals represent the electric
dipole moment at time t0. Thus

In the static case, the first two terms are the monopole and dipole contributions to
the multipole expansion for V ; the third term, of course, would not be present.
Meanwhile, the vector potential is

As you’ll see in a moment, to first order in r ′ it suffices to replace r by r in the

Now you see why it was unnecessary to carry the approximation of r beyond the
zeroth order (r ∼
= r ): p is already first order in r ′, and any refinements would be
corrections of second order (or higher).
Next we must calculate the fields. Once again, we are interested in the radiation
zone (that is, in the fields that survive at large distances from the source), so we
keep only those terms that go like 1/r :
approximation 3 : discard 1/r 2 terms in E and B. (11.55)

11.1 Dipole Radiation 481
Example 11.2.
(a) In the case of an oscillating electric dipole,
p(t)= p0 cos(ωt),¨
p(t)= −ω2 p0 cos(ωt),
and we recover the results of Sect. 11.1.2.
(b) For a single point charge q, the dipole moment is
p(t)= qd(t),
where d is the position of q with respect to the origin. Accordingly,
¨
p(t)= qa(t),
where a is the acceleration of the charge. In this case the power radiated
(Eq. 11.60) is
P=
μ0q2a2
6πc. (11.61)
This is the famous Larmor formula; I’ll derive it again, by rather different
means, in the next section. Notice that the power radiated by a point charge
is proportional to the square of its acceleration.
What I have done in this section amounts to a multipole expansion of the
retarded potentials, carried to the lowest order in r ′ that is capable of produc-
ing electromagnetic radiation (fields that go like 1/r ). This turns out to be the
electric dipole term. Because charge is conserved, an electric monopole does not
radiate—if charge were not conserved, the first term in Eq. 11.51 would read
Vmono =

You might think that a charged sphere whose radius oscillates in and out would
radiate, but it doesn’t—the field outside, according to Gauss’s law, is exactly
(Q/4πϵ0r 2)ˆ
r, regardless of the fluctuations in size. (In the acoustical analog, by
the way, monopoles do radiate: witness the croak of a bullfrog.)
If the electric dipole moment should happen to vanish (or, at any rate, if its
second time derivative is zero), then there is no electric dipole radiation, and one
must look to the next term: the one of second order in r ′. As it happens, this term
can be separated into two parts, one of which is related to the magnetic dipole
482 Chapter 11 Radiation
moment of the source, the other to its electric quadrupole moment. (The former
is a generalization of the magnetic dipole radiation we considered in Sect. 11.1.3.)
If the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions vanish, the (r ′)3 term
must be considered. This yields magnetic quadrupole and electric octopole radia-
tion . . . and so it goes.

However, not all of this energy flux constitutes radiation; some of it is just field
energy carried along by the particle as it moves. The radiated energy is the stuff
that, in effect, detaches itself from the charge and propagates off to infinity. (It’s
like flies breeding on a garbage truck: Some of them hover around the truck
as it makes its rounds; others fly away and never come back.) To calculate the
total power radiated by the particle at time tr , we draw a huge sphere of radius r
(Fig. 11.10), centered at the position of the particle (at time tr ), wait the appropri-
ate interval

for the radiation to reach the sphere, and at that moment integrate the Poynting
vector over the surface.8 I have used the notation tr because, in fact, this is the
retarded time for all points on the sphere at time t.
Now, the area of the sphere is proportional to r2, so any term in S that goes like
1/r2 will yield a finite answer, but terms like 1/r3 or 1/r4 will contribute nothing
in the limit r → ∞. For this reason, only the acceleration fields represent true
radiation (hence their other name, radiation fields):
Erad =
q
4πϵ0
r
(r· u)3 [r× (u × a)]. (11.66)
The velocity fields carry energy, to be sure, and as the charge moves this energy is
dragged along—but it’s not radiation. (It’s like the flies that stay with the garbage
truck.) Now Erad is perpendicular toˆ
r, so the second term in Eq. 11.64 vanishes:

route (Eq. 11.61).
Although I derived them on the assumption that v = 0, Eqs. 11.69 and 11.70
actually hold to good approximation as long as v ≪ c. An exact treatment of the
case v ̸= 0 is harder,9 both for the obvious reason that Erad is more complicated,

9In the context of special relativity, the condition v = 0 simply represents an astute choice of reference
system, with no essential loss of generality. If you can decide how P transforms, you can deduce the
general (Liénard) result from the v = 0 (Larmor) formula (see Prob. 12.71).
11.2 Point Charges 485
and also for the more subtle reason that Srad, the rate at which energy passes
through the sphere, is not the same as the rate at which energy left the particle.
Suppose someone is firing a stream of bullets out the window of a moving car
(Fig.11.12). The rate Nt at which the bullets strike a stationary target is not the
same as the rate Ng at which they left the gun, because of the motion of the car.
In fact, you can easily check that Ng = (1− v/c)Nt , if the car is moving towards
the target, and
Ng = 1−
ˆ

for arbitrary directions (here v is the velocity of the car, c is that of the bullets—
relative to the ground—andˆ
ris a unit vector from car to target). In our case, if

rate at which energy left the charge was

out and pushed forward by the factor (1− β cos θ)−5, as indicated in Fig. 11.13.
Although there is still no radiation in precisely the forward direction, most of it is

whether the particle is accelerating or decelerating; it only depends on the square
of a, and is concentrated in the forward direction (with respect to the velocity) in
either case. When a high speed electron hits a metal target it rapidly decelerates,
giving off what is called bremsstrahlung, or “braking radiation.” What I have
described in this example is essentially the classical theory of bremsstrahlung.

For relativistic velocities (β ≈ 1) the radiation is again sharply peaked in the for-
ward direction (Fig. 11.15). The most important application of these formulas is to
circular motion—in this case the radiation is called synchrotron radiation. For a
relativistic electron, the radiation sweeps around like a locomotive’s headlight as
the particle moves.]
11.2.2 Radiation Reaction
An accelerating charge radiates. This radiation carries off energy, which comes,
ultimately, at the expense of the particle’s kinetic energy. Under the influence of
a given force, therefore, a charged particle accelerates less than a neutral one of
the same mass. The radiation exerts a force (Frad) back on the charge—a recoil
force, rather like that of a bullet on a gun. In this section I’ll derive the radiation
reaction force from conservation of energy. Then, in the next section, I’ll show
you the actual mechanism responsible, and derive the reaction force again in the
context of a simple model.
For a nonrelativistic particle (v ≪ c), the total power radiated is given by the
Larmor formula (Eq. 11.70):
μ0q2a2
P=
6πc. (11.76)
Conservation of energy suggests that this is also the rate at which the particle loses
energy, under the influence of the radiation reaction force Frad:
μ0q2a2
Frad· v = −
6πc. (11.77)
I say “suggests” advisedly, because this equation is actually wrong. For we cal-
culated the radiated power by integrating the Poynting vector over a sphere of
“infinite” radius; in this calculation the velocity fields played no part, since they
fall off too rapidly as a function of r to make any contribution. But the velocity
fields do carry energy—they just don’t transport it out to infinity. As the parti-
cle accelerates and decelerates, energy is exchanged between it and the velocity
fields, at the same time as energy is irretrievably radiated away by the acceleration
fields. Equation 11.77 accounts only for the latter, but if we want to know the re-
coil force exerted by the fields on the charge, we need to consider the total power
lost at any instant, not just the portion that eventually escapes in the form of ra-
diation. (The term “radiation reaction” is a misnomer. We should really call it the
field reaction. In fact, we’ll soon see that Frad is determined by the time deriva-
tive of the acceleration and can be nonzero even when the acceleration itself is
instantaneously zero, and the particle is not radiating.)
The energy lost by the particle in any given time interval, then, must equal
the energy carried away by the radiation plus whatever extra energy has been
pumped into the velocity fields.10 However, if we agree to consider only intervals
10Actually, while the total field is the sum of velocity and acceleration fields, E= Ev + Ea , the energy
is proportional to E2 = E2

over which the system returns to its initial state, then the energy in the velocity
fields is the same at both ends, and the only net loss is in the form of radiation.

Of course, Eq. 11.79 doesn’t prove Eq. 11.80. It tells you nothing whatever
about the component of Frad perpendicular to v, and it only tells you the time
average of the parallel component—the average, moreover, over very special time
intervals. As we’ll see in the next section, there are other reasons for believing in
the Abraham-Lorentz formula, but for now, the best that can be said is that it
represents the simplest form the radiation reaction force could take, consistent
with conservation of energy.
The Abraham-Lorentz formula has disturbing implications, which are not
entirely understood a century after the law was first proposed. For suppose a
particle is subject to no external forces; then Newton’s second law says

fields alone (E2
v), energy radiated away (E2
a ), and a cross term Ev· Ea . For the sake of simplicity, I’m
referring to the combination (E2
v + 2Ev· Ea ) as “energy stored in the velocity fields.” These terms go
like 1/r4 and 1/r3, respectively, so neither one contributes to the radiation.
11For nonperiodic motion the condition that the energy in the velocity fields be the same at t1 and t2 is
more difficult to achieve. It is not enough that the instantaneous velocities and accelerations be equal,
since the fields farther out depend on v and a at earlier times. In principle, then, v and a and all higher
derivatives must be identical at t1 and t2. In practice, since the velocity fields fall off rapidly with r, it
is sufficient that v and a be the same over a brief interval prior to t1 and t2.

from which it follows that
a(t)= a0et/τ
, (11.81)
where
τ ≡
μ0q2
6πmc. (11.82)
(In the case of the electron, τ = 6 × 10−24s.) The acceleration spontaneously
increases exponentially with time! This absurd conclusion can be avoided if we
insist that a0 = 0, but it turns out that the systematic exclusion of such runaway
solutions has an even more unpleasant consequence: If you do apply an external
force, the particle starts to respond before the force acts! (See Prob. 11.19.) This
acausal preacceleration jumps the gun by only a short time τ; nevertheless, it is
(to my mind) unacceptable that the theory should countenance it at all.12
Example 11.4. Calculate the radiation damping of a charged particle attached
to a spring of natural frequency ω0, driven at frequency ω.
Solution
The equation of motion is

simplicity that the damping was proportional to the velocity. We now know that
12These difficulties persist in the relativistic version of the Abraham-Lorentz equation, which can be
derived by starting with Liénard’s formula instead of Larmor’s (Prob. 12.72). Perhaps they are telling
us that there can be no such thing as a point charge in classical electrodynamics, or maybe they presage
the onset of quantum mechanics. For guides to the literature, see Philip Pearle’s chapter in D. Teplitz,
ed., Electromagnetism: Paths to Research (New York: Plenum, 1982) and F. Rohrlich, Am. J. Phys.

radiation damping, at least, is proportional to¨
v. But it hardly matters: for sinu-
soidal oscillations any even number of derivatives of v would do, since they’re all
proportional to v.]
Problem 11.17
(a) A particle of charge q moves in a circle of radius R at a constant speed v. To
sustain the motion, you must, of course, provide a centripetal force mv2/R;
what additional force (Fe ) must you exert, in order to counteract the radia-
tion reaction? [It’s easiest to express the answer in terms of the instantaneous
velocity v.] What power (Pe ) does this extra force deliver? Compare Pe with the
power radiated (use the Larmor formula).
(b) Repeat part (a) for a particle in simple harmonic motion with amplitude A and
angular frequency ω: w(t)= A cos(ωt)ˆ
z. Explain the discrepancy.
(c) Consider the case of a particle in free fall (constant acceleration g). What is
the radiation reaction force? What is the power radiated? Comment on these
results.
Problem 11.18 A point charge q, of mass m, is attached to a spring of constant k.
At time t = 0 it is given a kick, so its initial energy is U0 =
1
2 mv2
0 . Now it oscillates,
gradually radiating away this energy.
(a) Confirm that the total energy radiated is equal to U0. Assume the radiation
damping is small, so you can write the equation of motion as
¨
x + γ˙
x + ω2
0 x = 0,
and the solution as
v0
x(t)=
e−γt/2 sin(ω0t),
ω0
with ω0 ≡ √k/m, γ= ω2
0 τ, and γ ≪ ω0 (drop γ2 in comparison to ω2
0 , and
when you average over a complete cycle, ignore the change in e−γt ).
(b) Suppose now we have two such oscillators, and we start them off with identical
kicks. Regardless of their relative positions and orientations, the total energy
radiated must be 2U0. But what if they are right on top of each other, so it’s
equivalent to a single oscillator with twice the charge; the Larmor formula says
that the power radiated is four times as great, suggesting that the total will be
4U0. Find the error in this reasoning, and show that the total is actually 2U0, as
it should be.13
Problem 11.19 With the inclusion of the radiation reaction force (Eq. 11.80),
Newton’s second law for a charged particle becomes
a = τ˙

where F is the external force acting on the particle.

492 Chapter 11 Radiation
(a) In contrast to the case of an uncharged particle (a = F/m), acceleration (like
position and velocity) must now be a continuous function of time, even if the
force changes abruptly. (Physically, the radiation reaction damps out any rapid
change in a.) Prove that a is continuous at any time t, by integrating the equation
of motion above from (t− ϵ) to (t + ϵ) and taking the limit ϵ → 0.
(b) A particle is subjected to a constant force F, beginning at time t = 0 and lasting
until time T . Find the most general solution a(t) to the equation of motion in
each of the three periods: (i) t < 0; (ii) 0 < t < T ; (iii) t > T .
(c) Impose the continuity condition (a) at t = 0 and t = T . Show that you can
either eliminate the runaway in region (iii) or avoid preacceleration in region
(i), but not both.
(d) If you choose to eliminate the runaway, what is the acceleration as a function
of time, in each interval? How about the velocity? (The latter must, of course,
be continuous at t = 0 and t = T .) Assume the particle was originally at rest:
v(−∞)= 0.
(e) Plot a(t) and v(t), both for an uncharged particle and for a (nonrunaway)
charged particle, subject to this force.
11.2.3 The Mechanism Responsible for the Radiation Reaction
In the last section, I derived the Abraham-Lorentz formula for the radiation re-
action, using conservation of energy. I made no attempt to identify the actual
mechanism responsible for this force, except to point out that it must be a recoil
effect of the particle’s own fields acting back on the charge. Unfortunately, the
fields of a point charge blow up right at the particle, so it’s hard to see how one
can calculate the force they exert.14 Let’s avoid this problem by considering an
extended charge distribution, for which the field is finite everywhere; at the end,
we’ll take the limit as the size of the charge goes to zero. In general, the electro-
magnetic force of one part ( A) on another part (B) is not equal and opposite to
the force of B on A (Fig. 11.16). If the distribution is divided up into infinitesimal
chunks, and the imbalances are added up for all such pairs, the result is a net force
of the charge on itself. It is this self-force, resulting from the breakdown of New-
ton’s third law within the structure of the particle, that accounts for the radiation
reaction.
Lorentz originally calculated the electromagnetic self-force using a spherical
charge distribution, which seems reasonable but makes the mathematics rather
cumbersome.15 Because I am only trying to elucidate the mechanism involved,
I shall use a less realistic model: a “dumbbell” in which the total charge q is
divided into two halves separated by a fixed distance d (Fig. 11.17). This is the
simplest possible arrangement of the charge that permits the essential mechanism
14It can be done by a suitable averaging of the field, but it’s not easy. See T. H. Boyer, Am. J. Phys.
40, 1843 (1972), and references cited there.

unlikely model for an elementary particle: in the point limit (d → 0) any model
must yield the Abraham-Lorentz formula, to the extent that conservation of energy
alone dictates that answer.

The first term on the right is proportional to the acceleration of the charge; if
we pull it over to the other side of Newton’s second law, it simply adds to the
dumbbell’s mass. In effect, the total inertia of the charged dumbbell is
m = 2m0 +
1
4πϵ0
q2
4dc2 , (11.97)
where m0 is the mass of either end alone. In the context of special relativity, it

mass of the dumbbell. For the potential energy of this configuration (in the static
case) is

(q/2)2
4πϵ0
d, (11.98)
and according to Einstein’s formula E= mc2, this energy contributes to the iner-
tia of the object.17
The second term in Eq. 11.96 is the radiation reaction:
Fint
rad =
μ0q2˙
a
12πc. (11.99)
It alone (apart from the mass correction18) survives in the “point dumbbell” limit
d → 0. Unfortunately, it differs from the Abraham-Lorentz formula by a factor
of 2. But then, this is only the self-force associated with the interaction between 1
and 2—hence the superscript “int.” There remains the force of each end on itself.
When the latter is included (see Prob. 11.20), the result is
Frad =
μ0q2˙
a
6πc
, (11.100)
17The fact that the numbers work out perfectly is a lucky feature of this configuration. If you do the
same calculation for the dumbbell in longitudinal motion, the mass correction is only half of what it
“should” be (there’s a 2, instead of a 4, in Eq. 11.97), and for a sphere it’s off by a factor of 3/4. This
notorious paradox has been the subject of much debate over the years. See D. J. Griffiths and R. E.
Owen, Am. J. Phys. 51, 1120 (1983).
18Of course, the limit d → 0 has an embarrassing effect on the mass term. In a sense, it doesn’t matter,
since only the total mass m is observable; maybe m0 somehow has a compensating (negative!) infinity,
so that m comes out finite. This awkward problem persists in quantum electrodynamics, where it is
“swept under the rug” in a procedure known as mass renormalization.

reproducing the Abraham-Lorentz formula exactly. Conclusion: The radiation
reaction is due to the force of the charge on itself—or, more elaborately, the net
force exerted by the fields generated by different parts of the charge distribution
acting on one another.
!
Problem 11.20 Deduce Eq. 11.100 from Eq. 11.99. Here are three methods:
(a) Use the Abraham-Lorentz formula to determine the radiation reaction on each
end of the dumbbell; add this to the interaction term (Eq. 11.99).
(b) Method (a) has the defect that it uses the Abraham-Lorentz formula—the
very thing that we were trying to derive. To avoid this, let F(q) be the total
d-independent part of the self-force on a charge q. Then
F(q)= Fint(q) + 2F(q/2),
where Fint is the interaction part (Eq. 11.99), and F(q/2) is the self-force on
each end. Now, F(q) must be proportional to q2, since the field is proportional
to q and the force is qE. So F(q/2)= (1/4)F(q). Take it from there.
(c) Smear out the charge along a strip of length L oriented perpendicular to the
motion (the charge density, then, is λ= q/L); find the cumulative interaction
force for all pairs of segments, using Eq. 11.99 (with the correspondence q/2 →
λ d y1, at one end and q/2 → λ d y2 at the other). Make sure you don’t count the
same pair twice.

KRUD broadcasts from this antenna at (angular) frequency ω, with a total radiated

about problems they attribute to excessive radiation from the tower—interference
with their stereo systems, mechanical garage doors opening and closing mysteri-
ously, and a variety of suspicious medical problems. But the city engineer who
measured the radiation level at the base of the tower found it to be well below the
accepted standard. You have been hired by the Neighborhood Association to assess
the engineer’s report.

are taken, the detector will be aimed directly at the antenna.]

12 Electrodynamics and Relativity
12.1 THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY
12.1.1 Einstein’s Postulates
Classical mechanics obeys the principle of relativity: the same laws apply in
any inertial reference frame. By “inertial” I mean that the system is at rest or
moving with constant velocity.1 Imagine, for example, that you have loaded a
billiard table onto a railroad car, and the train is going at constant speed down
a smooth straight track. The game will proceed exactly the same as it would
if the train were parked in the station; you don’t have to “correct” your shots
for the fact that the train is moving—indeed, if you pulled all the curtains, you
would have no way of knowing whether the train was moving or not. Notice
by contrast that you know immediately if the train speeds up, or slows down,
or rounds a corner, or goes over a bump—the billiard balls roll in weird curved
trajectories, and you yourself feel a lurch and spill coffee on your shirt. The
laws of mechanics, then, are certainly not the same in accelerating reference
frames.
In its application to classical mechanics, the principle of relativity is hardly
new; it was stated clearly by Galileo. Question: does it also apply to the laws of
electrodynamics? At first glance, the answer would seem to be no. After all, a
charge in motion produces a magnetic field, whereas a charge at rest does not. A
charge carried along by the train would generate a magnetic field, but someone on
the train, applying the laws of electrodynamics in that system, would predict no
magnetic field. In fact, many of the equations of electrodynamics, starting with
the Lorentz force law, make explicit reference to “the” velocity of the charge.
It certainly appears, therefore, that electromagnetic theory presupposes the exis-
tence of a unique stationary reference frame, with respect to which all velocities
are to be measured.
And yet there is an extraordinary coincidence that gives us pause. Suppose we
mount a wire loop on a freight car, and have the train pass between the poles of a
1This raises an awkward problem: If the laws of physics hold just as well in a uniformly moving frame,
then we have no way of identifying the “rest” frame in the first place, and hence no way of checking
that some other frame is moving at constant velocity. To avoid this trap, we define an inertial frame
formally as one in which Newton’s first law holds. If you want to know whether you’re in an inertial
frame, throw some rocks around—if they travel in straight lines at constant speed, you’ve got yourself
an inertial frame, and any frame moving at constant velocity with respect to you will be another inertial
frame (see Prob. 12.1).

Wire loop
FIGURE 12.1
giant magnet (Fig. 12.1). As the loop rides through the magnetic field, a motional
emf is established; according to the flux rule (Eq. 7.13),
E= −
d
dt.
This emf, remember, is due to the magnetic force on charges in the wire loop,
which are moving along with the train. On the other hand, if someone on the
train naïvely applied the laws of electrodynamics in that system, what would the
prediction be? No magnetic force, because the loop is at rest. But as the magnet
flies by, the magnetic field in the freight car changes, and a changing magnetic
field induces an electric field, by Faraday’s law. The resulting electric force would
generate an emf in the loop given by Eq. 7.14:
E= −
d
dt.
Because Faraday’s law and the flux rule predict exactly the same emf, people on
the train will get the right answer, even though their physical interpretation of the
process is completely wrong!
Or is it? Einstein could not believe this was a mere coincidence; he took it,
rather, as a clue that electromagnetic phenomena, like mechanical ones, obey the
principle of relativity. In his view, the analysis by the observer on the train is just
as valid as that of the observer on the ground. If their interpretations differ (one
calling the process electric, the other magnetic), so be it; their actual predictions
are in agreement. Here’s what he wrote on the first page of his 1905 paper intro-
ducing the special theory of relativity:
It is known that Maxwell’s electrodynamics—as usually understood at
the present time—when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries
which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. Take, for example, the
reciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor. The observ-
able phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor
and the magnet, whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction be-
tween the two cases in which either one or the other of these bodies is in
motion. For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest, there arises
504 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity
in the neighborhood of the magnet an electric field . . . producing a current
at the places where parts of the conductor are situated. But if the magnet is
stationary and the conductor in motion, no electric field arises in the neigh-
borhood of the magnet. In the conductor, however, we find an electromotive
force . . . which gives rise—assuming equality of relative motion in the two
cases discussed—to electric currents of the same path and intensity as those
produced by the electric forces in the former case.
Examples of this sort, together with unsuccessful attempts to discover
any motion of the earth relative to the “light medium,” suggest that the phe-
nomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties
corresponding to the idea of absolute rest.2
But I’m getting ahead of the story. To Einstein’s predecessors, the equality
of the two emfs was just a lucky accident; they had no doubt that one observer
was right and the other was wrong. They thought of electric and magnetic fields as
strains in an invisible jellylike medium called ether, which permeated all of space.
The speed of the charge was to be measured with respect to the ether—only then
would the laws of electrodynamics be valid. The train observer is wrong, because
that frame is moving relative to the ether.
But wait a minute! How do we know the ground observer isn’t moving relative
to the ether, too? After all, the earth rotates on its axis once a day and revolves
around the sun once a year; the solar system circulates around the galaxy, and for
all I know the galaxy itself is moving at a high speed through the cosmos. All told,
we should be traveling at well over 50 km/s with respect to the ether. Like a mo-
torcycle rider on the open road, we face an “ether wind” of high velocity—unless
by some miraculous coincidence we just happen to find ourselves in a tailwind of
precisely the right strength, or the earth has some sort of “windshield” and drags
its local supply of ether along with it. Suddenly it becomes a matter of crucial im-
portance to find the ether frame, experimentally, or else all our calculations will
be invalid.
The problem, then, is to determine our motion through the ether—to measure
the speed and direction of the “ether wind.” How shall we do it? At first glance
you might suppose that practically any electromagnetic experiment would suf-
fice: If Maxwell’s equations are valid only with respect to the ether frame, any
discrepancy between the experimental result and the theoretical prediction would
be ascribable to the ether wind. Unfortunately, as nineteenth-century physicists
soon realized, the anticipated error in a typical experiment is extremely small; as
in the example above, “coincidences” always seem to conspire to hide the fact that
we are using the “wrong” reference frame. So it takes an uncommonly delicate
experiment to do the job.

12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 505
Now, among the results of classical electrodynamics is the prediction that elec-
tromagnetic waves travel through the vacuum at a speed
1
= 3.00 × 108m/s,
√ϵ0μ0
relative (presumably) to the ether. In principle, then, one should be able to detect
the ether wind by simply measuring the speed of light in various directions. Like a
motorboat on a river, the net speed “downstream” should be a maximum, for here
the light is swept along by the ether; in the opposite direction, where it is bucking
the current, the speed should be a minimum (Fig. 12.2).

Ether wind
FIGURE 12.2
While the idea of this experiment could not be simpler, its execution is another
matter, because light travels so inconveniently fast. If it weren’t for that “technical
detail,” you could do it with a flashlight and a stopwatch. As it happened, an
elaborate and lovely experiment was devised by Michelson and Morley, using an
optical interferometer of fantastic precision. I shall not go into the details here,
because I do not want to distract your attention from the two essential points: (1)
all Michelson and Morley were trying to do was compare the speed of light in
different directions, and (2) what they in fact discovered was that this speed is
exactly the same in all directions.
Nowadays, when students are taught in high school to snicker at the naïveté of
the ether model, it takes some imagination to comprehend how utterly perplexing
this result must have been at the time. All other waves (water waves, sound waves,
waves on a string) travel at a prescribed speed relative to the propagating medium
(the stuff that does the waving), and if this medium is in motion with respect to
the observer, the net speed is always greater “downstream” than “upstream.” Over
the next 20 years, a series of improbable schemes were concocted in an effort
to explain why this does not occur with light. Michelson and Morley themselves
interpreted their experiment as confirmation of the “ether drag” hypothesis, which
held that the earth somehow pulls the ether along with it. But this was found to be
inconsistent with other observations, notably the aberration of starlight.3 Various
so-called “emission” theories were proposed, according to which the speed of
electromagnetic waves is governed by the motion of the source—as it would be in
3A discussion of the Michelson-Morley experiment and related matters is to be found in R. Resnick’s
Introduction to special relativity (New York: John Wiley, 1968), Chapter 1.
506 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity
a corpuscular theory (conceiving of light as a stream of particles). Such theories
called for implausible modifications in Maxwell’s equations, but in any event they
were discredited by experiments using extraterrestrial light sources. Meanwhile,
Fitzgerald and Lorentz suggested that the ether wind physically compresses all
matter (including the Michelson-Morley apparatus itself) in just the right way to
compensate for, and thereby conceal, the variation in speed with direction. As it
turns out, there is a grain of truth in this, although their idea of the reason for the
contraction was quite wrong.
At any rate, it was not until Einstein that anyone took the Michelson-Morley
result at face value, and suggested that the speed of light is a universal constant,
the same in all directions, regardless of the motion of the observer or the source.
There is no ether wind because there is no ether. Any inertial system is a suitable
reference frame for the application of Maxwell’s equations, and the velocity of a
charge is to be measured not with respect to a (nonexistent) absolute rest frame,
nor with respect to a (nonexistent) ether, but simply with respect to the particular
inertial system you happen to have chosen.
Inspired, then, both by internal theoretical hints (the fact that the laws of elec-
trodynamics are such as to give the right answer even when applied in the “wrong”
system) and by external empirical evidence (the Michelson-Morley experiment4),
Einstein proposed his two famous postulates:
1. The principle of relativity. The laws of physics apply in all inertial
reference systems.
2. The universal speed of light. The speed of light in vacuum is the
same for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the source.
The special theory of relativity derives from these two postulates. The first ele-
vates Galileo’s observation about classical mechanics to the status of a general
law, applying to all of physics. It states that there is no absolute rest system. The
second might be considered Einstein’s response to the Michelson-Morley exper-
iment. It means that there is no ether. (Some authors consider Einstein’s second
postulate redundant—no more than a special case of the first. They maintain that
the very existence of ether would violate the principle of relativity, in the sense
that it would define a unique stationary reference frame. I think this is nonsense.
The existence of air as a medium for sound does not invalidate the theory of
relativity. Ether is no more an absolute rest system than the water in a goldfish
bowl—which is a special system, if you happen to be the goldfish, but scarcely
“absolute.”)5
Unlike the principle of relativity, which had roots going back several cen-
turies, the universal speed of light was radically new—and, on the face of it,
4Actually, Einstein appears to have been only dimly aware of the Michelson-Morley experiment at the
time. For him, the theoretical argument was decisive.
5I put it this way in an effort to dispel some misunderstanding as to what constitutes an absolute rest
frame. In 1977, it became possible to measure the speed of the earth through the 3 K background
radiation left over from the “big bang.” Does this mean we have found an absolute rest system, and
relativity is out the window? Of course not.
12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 507
preposterous. For if I walk 5 mi/h down the corridor of a train going 60 mi/h,
my net speed relative to the ground is “obviously” 65 mi/h—the speed of A (me)
with respect to C (ground) is equal to the speed of A relative to B (train) plus the
speed of B relative to C:
vAC = vA B + vBC. (12.1)
And yet, if A is a light signal (whether it comes from a flashlight on the train or
a lamp on the ground or a star in the sky) Einstein would have us believe that its
speed is c relative to the train and c relative to the ground:
vAC = vA B = c. (12.2)
Clearly, Eq. 12.1, which we now call Galileo’s velocity addition rule (no one
before Einstein would have bothered to give it a name at all) is incompatible
with the second postulate. In special relativity, as we shall see, it is replaced by
Einstein’s velocity addition rule:
vA B + vBC
vAC =
. (12.3)
1 + (vA B vBC /c2)
For “ordinary” speeds (vA B ≪ c,vBC ≪ c), the denominator is so close to 1 that
the discrepancy between Galileo’s formula and Einstein’s formula is negligible.
On the other hand, Einstein’s formula has the desired property that if vA B = c,
then automatically vAC = c:
c + vBC
vAC =
= c.
1 + (cvBC /c2)
But how can Galileo’s rule, which seems to rely on nothing but common sense,
possibly be wrong? And if it is wrong, what does this do to all of classical physics?
The answer is that special relativity compels us to alter our notions of space and
time themselves, and therefore also of such derived quantities as velocity, mo-
mentum, and energy. Although it developed historically out of Einstein’s contem-
plation of electrodynamics, the special theory is not limited to any particular class
of phenomena—rather, it is a description of the space-time “arena” in which all
physical phenomena take place. And in spite of the reference to the speed of light
in the second postulate, relativity has nothing to do with light: c is a fundamental
velocity, and it happens that light travels at that speed, but it is perfectly possi-
ble to conceive of a universe in which there are no electric charges, and hence
no electromagnetic fields or waves, and yet relativity would still prevail. Because
relativity defines the structure of space and time, it claims authority not merely
over all presently known phenomena, but over those not yet discovered. It is, as
Kant would say, a “prolegomenon to any future physics.”

some mass rubs off A and onto B, and we are left with particles C (mass mC ,

12.1.2 The Geometry of Relativity
In this section I present a series of gedanken (thought) experiments that serve
to introduce the three most striking geometrical consequences of Einstein’s pos-
tulates: time dilation, Lorentz contraction, and the relativity of simultaneity. In
Sect. 12.1.3 the same results will be derived more systematically, using Lorentz
transformations.

(i) The relativity of simultaneity. Imagine a freight car, traveling at constant
speed along a smooth, straight track (Fig. 12.4). In the very center of the car
there hangs a light bulb. When someone switches it on, the light spreads out in
all directions at speed c. Because the lamp is equidistant from the two ends, an
observer on the train will find that the light reaches the front end at the same
instant as it reaches the back end: The two events in question—(a) light reaches
the front end (and maybe a buzzer goes off) and (b) light reaches the back end
(another buzzer sounds)—occur simultaneously.
However, to an observer on the ground these same two events are not simul-
taneous. For as the light travels out from the bulb (going at speed c in both
directions—that’s the second postulate), the train itself moves forward, so the
beam going to the back end has a shorter distance to travel than the one going
forward (Fig. 12.5). According to this observer, therefore, event (b) happens be-
fore event (a). An observer passing by on an express train, meanwhile, would
report that (a) preceded (b). Conclusion:
Two events that are simultaneous in one inertial system are not, in
general, simultaneous in another.
Naturally, the train has to be going awfully fast before the discrepancy becomes
detectable—that’s why you don’t notice it all the time.
Of course, it’s always possible for a naïve witness to be mistaken about si-
multaneity: a person sitting in the back corner of the car would hear buzzer b
before buzzer a, simply because he’s closer to the source of the sound, and a child
might infer that b actually rang before a. But this is a trivial error, having nothing
to do with special relativity—obviously, you must correct for the time the signal
(sound, light, carrier pigeon, or whatever) takes to reach you. When I speak of an
observer, I mean someone with the sense to make this correction, and an obser-
vation is what he records after doing so. What you hear or see, therefore, is not
the same as what you observe. An observation is an artificial reconstruction after
the fact, when all the data are in, and it doesn’t depend on where the observer
is located. In fact, a wise observer will avoid the whole problem by stationing
assistants at strategic locations, each equipped with a watch synchronized to a
master clock, so that time measurements can be made right at the scene. I belabor
this point in order to emphasize that the relativity of simultaneity is a genuine
discrepancy between measurements made by competent observers in relative mo-
tion, not a simple mistake arising from a failure to account for the travel time of
light signals.

Problem 12.5 Synchronized clocks are stationed at regular intervals, a million km
apart, along a straight line. When the clock next to you reads 12 noon:
(a) What time do you see on the 90th clock down the line?
(b) What time do you observe on that clock?
Problem 12.6 Every 2 years, more or less, The New York Times publishes an article
in which some astronomer claims to have found an object traveling faster than the
speed of light. Many of these reports result from a failure to distinguish what is
seen from what is observed—that is, from a failure to account for light travel time.
Here’s an example: A star is traveling with speed v at an angle θ to the line of sight
(Fig. 12.6). What is its apparent speed across the sky? (Suppose the light signal from
b reaches the earth at a time t after the signal from a, and the star has meanwhile
advanced a distance s across the celestial sphere; by “apparent speed,” I mean
s/t.) What angle θ gives the maximum apparent speed? Show that the apparent
speed can be much greater than c, even if v itself is less than c.

(ii) Time dilation. Now let’s consider a light ray that leaves the bulb and strikes
the floor of the car directly below. Question: How long does it take the light to
make this trip? From the point of view of an observer on the train, the answer is
easy: If the height of the car is h, the time is

FIGURE 12.7

(I’ll use an overbar to denote measurements made on the train.) On the other hand,
as observed from the ground, this same ray must travel farther, because the train
itself is moving. From Fig. 12.7, I see that this distance is h2 + (vt)2, so
t =
h2 + (vt)2
c.
Solving for t, we have
t =
h

1− v2/c2 ,
and therefore
¯
t = 1− v2/c2 t. (12.5)
Evidently the time elapsed between the same two events—(a) light leaves bulb,
and (b) light strikes center of floor—is different for the two observers. In fact, the
interval recorded on the train clock,¯
t, is shorter by the factor
γ ≡
1
1− v2/c2. (12.6)
Conclusion:
Moving clocks run slow.
This is called time dilation. It doesn’t have anything to do with the mechanics
of clocks; it’s a statement about the nature of time, which applies to all properly
functioning timepieces.
Of all Einstein’s predictions, none has received more spectacular and persua-
sive confirmation than time dilation. Most elementary particles are unstable: they
disintegrate after a characteristic lifetime6 that varies from one species to the next.
The lifetime of a neutron is 15 min; of a muon, 2 × 10−6 s; and of a neutral pion,
9 × 10−17 s. But these are lifetimes of particles at rest. When particles are mov-
ing at speeds close to c they last much longer, for their internal clocks (whatever
it is that tells them when their time is up) are running slow, in accordance with
Einstein’s time dilation formula.
Example 12.1. speed of light. How long does it last?
A muon is traveling through the laboratory at three-fifths the

process, and I should really speak of the average lifetime for the species. But to avoid irrelevant
complication, I shall pretend that every particle disintegrates after precisely the average lifetime.

It may strike you that time dilation is inconsistent with the principle of relativ-
ity. For if the ground observer says the train clock runs slow, the train observer can
with equal justice claim that the ground clock runs slow—after all, from the train’s
point of view it is the ground that is in motion. Who’s right? Answer: They’re both
right! On closer inspection, the “contradiction,” which seems so stark, evaporates.
Let me explain: In order to check the rate of the train clock, the ground observer
uses two of his own clocks (Fig. 12.8): one to compare times at the beginning of
the interval, when the train clock passes point A, the other to compare times at
the end of the interval, when the train clock passes point B. Of course, he must
be careful to synchronize his clocks before the experiment. What he finds is that
while the train clock ticked off, say, 3 minutes, the interval between his own two
clock readings was 5 minutes. He concludes that the train clock runs slow.
Meanwhile, the observer on the train is checking the rate of the ground clock
by the same procedure: She uses two carefully synchronized train clocks, and
compares times with a single ground clock as it passes by each of them in turn
(Fig. 12.9). She finds that while the ground clock ticks off 3 minutes, the interval
between her train clocks is 5 minutes, and concludes that the ground clock runs
slow. Is there a contradiction? No, for the two observers have measured different
things. The ground observer compared one train clock with two ground clocks;
the train observer compared one ground clock with two train clocks. Each fol-
lowed a sensible and correct procedure, comparing a single moving clock with
two stationary ones. “So what,” you say, “the stationary clocks were synchro-
nized in each instance, so it cannot matter that they used two different ones.”
But there’s the rub: Clocks that are properly synchronized in one system will not

be synchronized when observed from another system. They can’t be, for to say
that two clocks are synchronized is to say that they read 12 noon simultaneously,
and we have already learned that what’s simultaneous to one observer is not si-
multaneous to another. So whereas each observer conducted a perfectly sound
measurement, from his/her own point of view, the other observer (watching the
process) considers that she/he made the most elementary blunder in the book, by
using two unsynchronized clocks. That’s how, in spite of the fact that his clocks
“actually” run slow, he manages to conclude that hers are running slow (and vice
versa).
Because moving clocks are not synchronized, it is essential when checking
time dilation to focus attention on a single moving clock. All moving clocks run
slow by the same factor, but you can’t start timing on one clock and then switch
to another because they weren’t in step to begin with. But you can use as many
stationary clocks (stationary with respect to you, the observer) as you please, for
they are properly synchronized (moving observers would dispute this, but that’s
their problem).

Example 12.2. The twin paradox. On her 21st birthday, an astronaut takes off
in a rocket ship at a speed of 12
13 c. After 5 years have elapsed on her watch, she
turns around and heads back at the same speed to rejoin her twin brother, who
stayed at home. Question: How old is each twin at their reunion?
Solution
The traveling twin has aged 10 years (5 years out, 5 years back); she arrives at
home just in time to celebrate her 31st birthday. However, as viewed from earth,
the moving clock has been running slow by a factor
γ=
1
1− (12/13)2
=
5.
The time elapsed on earthbound clocks is 13
5 × 10= 26, and her brother will be
therefore celebrating his 47th birthday—he is now 16 years older than his twin sis-
ter! But don’t be deceived: This is no fountain of youth for the traveling twin, for
though she may die later than her brother, she will not have lived any more—she’s
just done it slower. During the flight, all her biological processes—metabolism,
pulse, thought, and speech—are subject to the same time dilation that affects her
watch.
The so-called twin paradox arises when you try to tell this story from the
point of view of the traveling twin. She sees the earth fly off at 12
13 c, turn around
after 5 years, and return. From her point of view, it would seem, she’s at rest,
whereas her brother is in motion, and hence it is he who should be younger at the
reunion. An enormous amount has been written about the twin paradox, but the
truth is there’s really no paradox here at all: this second analysis is simply wrong.
The two twins are not equivalent. The traveling twin experiences acceleration
when she turns around to head home, but her brother does not. To put it in fancier
language, the traveling twin is not in an inertial system—more precisely, she’s
514 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity
in one inertial system on the way out and a completely different inertial system
on the way back. You’ll see in Prob. 12.16 how to analyze this problem correctly
from her perspective, but as far as the resolution of the “paradox” is concerned, it
is enough to note that the traveling twin cannot claim to be a stationary observer
because you can’t undergo acceleration and remain stationary.

Problem 12.7 In a laboratory experiment, a muon is observed to travel 800 m before
disintegrating. A graduate student looks up the lifetime of a muon (2 × 10−6 s) and
concludes that its speed was
v =
= 4 × 108 m/s.
2 × 10−6 s
Faster than light! Identify the student’s error, and find the actual speed of this muon.
Problem 12.8 A rocket ship leaves earth at a speed of 3
5 c. When a clock on the
rocket says 1 hour has elapsed, the rocket ship sends a light signal back to earth.
(a) According to earth clocks, when was the signal sent?
(b) According to earth clocks, how long after the rocket left did the signal arrive
back on earth?
(c) According to the rocket observer, how long after the rocket left did the signal
arrive back on earth?
(iii) Lorentz contraction. For the third gedanken experiment you must imag-
ine that we have set up a lamp at one end of a boxcar and a mirror at the other,
so that a light signal can be sent down and back (Fig. 12.10). Question: How long
does the signal take to complete the round trip? To an observer on the train, the
answer is
¯
t = 2
¯
x
, (12.7)
c
where¯
x is the length of the car (the overbar, as before, denotes measurements
made on the train). To an observer on the ground, the process is more complicated
because of the motion of the train. If t1 is the time for the light signal to reach
the front end, and t2 is the return time, then (see Fig. 12.11):
t1 =
x + vt1

x− vt2

or, solving for t1 and t2:
t1 =

So the round-trip time is
t = t1 + t2 = 2

1
(1− v2/c2)

But these intervals are related by the time dilation formula, Eq. 12.5:
¯
t = 1− v2/c2 t.
Applying this to Eqs. 12.7 and 12.8, I conclude that
¯
x =
1
1− v2/c2
x. (12.9)
The length of the boxcar is not the same when measured by an observer on the
ground, as it is when measured by an observer on the train—from the ground
point of view, it is somewhat shorter. Conclusion:
Moving objects are shortened.
We call this Lorentz contraction. Notice that the same factor,
1
1− v2/c2 ,
appears in both the time dilation formula and the Lorentz contraction formula.
This makes it all very easy to remember: Moving clocks run slow, moving sticks
are shortened, and the factor is always γ.
Of course, the observer on the train doesn’t think her car is shortened—her
meter sticks are contracted by that same factor, so all her measurements come out
the same as when the train was standing in the station. In fact, from her point of
view it is objects on the ground that are shortened. This raises again a paradoxical
problem: If A says B’s sticks are short, and B says A’s sticks are short, who is
right? Answer: They both are! But to reconcile the rival claims we must study
carefully the actual process by which length is measured.
Suppose you want to find the length of a board. If it’s at rest (with respect to
you) you simply lay your ruler down next to the board, record the readings at
each end, and subtract (Fig. 12.12). (If you’re really clever, you’ll line up the left
end of the ruler against the left end of the board—then you only have to read one
number.)
But what if the board is moving? Same story, only this time, of course, you
must be careful to read the two ends at the same instant of time. If you don’t, the
γ ≡
516 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity
Board
Ruler
FIGURE 12.12
board will move in the course of measurement, and obviously you’ll get the wrong
answer. But therein lies the problem: Because of the relativity of simultaneity the
two observers disagree on what constitutes “the same instant of time.” When the
person on the ground measures the length of the boxcar, he reads the position of
the two ends at the same instant in his system. But the person on the train, watch-
ing him do it, complains that he read the front end first, then waited a moment
before reading the back end. Naturally, he came out short, in spite of the fact
that (to her) he was using an undersized meter stick, which would otherwise have
yielded a number too large. Both observers measure lengths correctly (from the
point of view of their respective inertial frames), and each finds the other’s sticks
to be shortened. Yet there is no inconsistency, for they are measuring different
things, and each considers the other’s method improper.
Example 12.3. The barn and ladder paradox. Unlike time dilation, there is
no direct experimental confirmation of Lorentz contraction, simply because it’s
too difficult to get an object of measurable size going anywhere near the speed
of light. The following parable illustrates how bizarre the world would be if the
speed of light were more accessible.
There once was a farmer who had a ladder too long to store in his barn
(Fig. 12.13a). He chanced one day to read some relativity, and a solution to his
problem suggested itself. He instructed his daughter to run with the ladder as
fast as she could—the moving ladder having Lorentz-contracted to a size the
barn could easily accommodate, she was to rush through the door, whereupon the
(a)
(b)
(c)
FIGURE 12.13
12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 517
farmer would slam it behind her, capturing the ladder inside (Fig. 12.13b). The
daughter, however, has read somewhat farther in the relativity book; she points
out that in her reference frame the barn, not the ladder, will contract, and the fit
will be even worse than it was with the two at rest (Fig. 12.13c). Question: Who’s
right? Will the ladder fit inside the barn, or won’t it?
Solution
They’re both right! When you say “the ladder is in the barn,” you mean that all
parts of it are inside at one instant of time, but in view of the relativity of si-
multaneity, that’s a condition that depends on the observer. There are really two
relevant events here:
a. Back end of ladder makes it in the door.
b. Front end of ladder hits far wall of barn.
The farmer says a occurs before b, so there is a time when the ladder is entirely
within the barn; his daughter says b precedes a, so there is not. Contradiction?
Nope—just a difference in perspective.
“But come now,” I hear you protest, “when it’s all over and the dust clears,
either the ladder is inside the barn, or it isn’t. There can be no dispute about that.”
Quite so, but now you’re introducing a new element into the story: What happens
as the ladder is brought to a stop? Suppose the farmer grabs the last rung of the
ladder firmly with one hand, while he slams the door with the other. Assuming
it remains intact, the ladder must now stretch out to its rest length. Evidently, the
front end keeps going, even after the rear end has stopped! Expanding like an
accordian, the front end of the ladder smashes into the far side of the barn. In
truth, the whole notion of a “rigid” object loses its meaning in relativity, for when
it changes its speed, different parts do not in general accelerate simultaneously—
in this way, the material stretches or shrinks to reach the length appropriate to its
new velocity.7
But to return to the question at hand: When the ladder finally comes to a stop,
is it inside the barn or not? The answer is indeterminate. When the front end of
the ladder hits the far side of the barn, something has to give, and the farmer is left
either with a broken ladder inside the barn or with the ladder intact poking through
a hole in the wall. In any event, he is unlikely to be pleased with the outcome.
One final comment on Lorentz contraction. A moving object is shortened only
along the direction of its motion:
Dimensions perpendicular to the velocity are not contracted.
Indeed, in deriving the time dilation formula I took it for granted that the height
of the train is the same for both observers. I’ll now justify this, using a lovely
gedanken experiment suggested by Taylor and Wheeler.8 Imagine that we build

a wall beside the railroad tracks, and 1 m above the rails (as measured on the
ground), we paint a horizontal blue line. When the train goes by, a passenger leans
out the window holding a wet paintbrush 1 m above the rails, as measured on the
train, leaving a horizontal red line on the wall. Question: Does the passenger’s red
line lie above or below our blue one? If the rule were that perpendicular directions
contract, then the person on the ground would predict that the red line is lower,
while the person on the train would say it’s the blue one (to the latter, of course,
the ground is moving). The principle of relativity says that both observers are
equally justified, but they cannot both be right. No subtleties of simultaneity or
synchronization can rationalize this contradiction; either the blue line is higher or
the red one is—unless they exactly coincide, which is the inescapable conclusion.
There cannot be a law of contraction (or expansion) of perpendicular dimensions,
for it would lead to irreconcilably inconsistent predictions.
Problem 12.9 A Lincoln Continental is twice as long as a VW Beetle, when they
are at rest. As the Continental overtakes the VW, going through a speed trap, a
(stationary) policeman observes that they both have the same length. The VW is
going at half the speed of light. How fast is the Lincoln going? (Leave your answer
as a multiple of c.)
Problem 12.10 A sailboat is manufactured so that the mast leans at an angle¯

to the diameter, in terms of ω and R? According to the rules of ordinary geometry,
it has to be π. What’s going on here?9

12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 519
12.1.3 The Lorentz Transformations
Any physical process consists of one or more events. An “event” is something
that takes place at a specific location (x, y, z), at a precise time (t). The explosion
of a firecracker, for example, is an event; a tour of Europe is not. Suppose we
know the coordinates (x, y, z,t) of a particular event E in one inertial system S,
and we would like to calculate the coordinates (¯
x,¯
y,¯
z,¯
t) of that same event in
some other inertial system¯
S. What we need is a “dictionary” for translating from
the language of S to the language of¯
S.
We may as well orient our axes as shown in Fig. 12.16, so that¯
S slides along
the x axis at speed v. If we “start the clock” (t = 0) at the moment the origins
(O and¯
O) coincide, then at time t,¯
O will be a distance vt from O, and hence
x = d + vt, (12.10)
where d is the distance from¯
O to¯
A at time t (¯
A is the point on the¯
x axis that
is even with E when the event occurs). Before Einstein, anyone would have said
immediately that
d = ¯ x, (12.11)
and thus constructed the “dictionary”
(i)¯
x = x− vt,
(ii)¯
y= y,
(iii)¯
z = z,
(iv)¯
t = t.

sumed the flow of time is the same for all observers. In the context of special

relativity, however, we must expect (iv) to be replaced by a rule that incorporates
time dilation, the relativity of simultaneity, and the nonsynchronization of moving
clocks. Likewise, there will be a modification in (i) to account for Lorentz con-
traction. As for (ii) and (iii), they, at least, remain unchanged, for we have already
seen that there can be no modification of lengths perpendicular to the motion.
But where does the classical derivation of (i) break down? Answer: In
Eq. 12.11. For d is the distance from¯
O to¯
A as measured in S, whereas¯
x is
the distance from¯
O to¯
A as measured in¯
S. Because¯
O and¯
A are at rest in¯
S,¯
x
is the “moving stick,” which appears contracted to S:
1
d=
¯
x. (12.13)
γ
When this is inserted in Eq. 12.10 we obtain the relativistic version of (i):
¯
x = γ(x− vt). (12.14)
Of course, we could have run the same argument from the point of view of
¯
S. The diagram (Fig. 12.17) looks similar, but in this case it depicts the scene at
time¯
t, whereas Fig. 12.16 showed the scene at time t. (Note that t and¯
t represent
the same physical instant at E, but not elsewhere, because of the relativity of
simultaneity.) If we assume that¯
S also starts its clock when the origins coincide,
then at time¯
t, O will be a distance v¯
t from¯
O, and therefore
¯
¯
x =
d− v¯
t, (12.15)
where¯
d is the distance from O to A at time¯
t, and A is that point on the x axis
that is even with E when the event occurs. The classical physicist would have said
¯
that x =
d, and, using (iv), recovered (i). But, as before, relativity demands that
we observe a subtle distinction: x is the distance from O to A in S, whereas¯
d is
the distance from O to A in¯
S. Because O and A are at rest in S, x is the “moving
stick,” and

12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity It follows that
521
x = γ(¯

This last equation comes as no surprise, for the symmetry of the situation dic-
tates that the formula for x, in terms of¯
x and¯
t, should be identical to the formula
for¯
x in terms of x and t (Eq. 12.14), except for a switch in the sign of v. (If¯
S is
going to the right at speed v, with respect to S, then S is going to the left at speed
v, with respect to¯
S.) Nevertheless, this is a useful result, for if we substitute¯
x
from Eq. 12.14, and solve for¯
t, we complete the relativistic “dictionary”:

x = γ(x− vt),

These are the famous Lorentz transformations, with which Einstein replaced
the Galilean ones. They contain all the geometrical information in the special
theory, as the following examples illustrate. The reverse dictionary, which carries
you from¯
S back to S, can be obtained algebraically by solving (i) and (iv) for x
and t, or, more simply, by switching the sign of v:

Example 12.4. Simultaneity, synchronization, and time dilation. Suppose
event A occurs at x A = 0,tA = 0, and event B occurs at xB = b,tB = 0. The
two events are simultaneous in S (they both take place at t = 0). But they are
not simultaneous in¯
S, for the Lorentz transformations give¯
x A = 0,¯
tA = 0 and

xB = γb,¯
tB = −γ(v/c2)b. According to the¯
S clocks, then, B occurred before
A. This is nothing new, of course—just the relativity of simultaneity. But I wanted
you to see how it follows from the Lorentz transformations.

Those to the left of the origin (negative x) are ahead, and those to the right are

Only the master clock at the origin reads¯
t = 0. Thus, the nonsynchronization of
moving clocks, too, follows directly from the Lorentz transformations. Of course,
from the¯
S viewpoint it is the S clocks that are out of synchronization, as you can
check by putting¯
t = 0 into equation (iv′).
Finally, suppose S focuses his attention on a single clock at rest in the¯
S frame
(say, the one at¯
x = a), and watches it over some interval t. How much time
¯
elapses on the moving clock? Because¯
x is fixed, (iv′) gives t = γ

That’s the old time dilation formula, derived now from the Lorentz transforma-
tions. Please note that it’s¯
x we hold fixed, here, because we’re watching one
moving clock. If you hold x fixed, then you’re watching a whole series of differ-
ent¯
S clocks as they pass by, and that won’t tell you whether any one of them is
running slow.
Example 12.5. Lorentz contraction. Imagine a stick at rest in¯
S (hence moving
to the right at speed v in S). Its rest length (that is, its length as measured in¯
S) is
¯
x = ¯ xr
− ¯ xl , where the subscripts denote the right and left ends of the stick. If
an observer in S were to measure the stick, he would subtract the positions of the
two ends at one instant of his time t: x = xr− xl (for tl = tr ). According to (i),
then,
1
x =
γ
¯
x.
This is the old Lorentz contraction formula. Note that it’s t we hold fixed, here,
because we’re talking about a measurement made by S, and he marks off the two
ends at the same instant of his time. (¯
S doesn’t have to be so fussy, since the stick
is at rest in her frame.)

Example 12.6. Einstein’s velocity addition rule. Suppose a particle moves a

This is Einstein’s velocity addition rule. To recover the more transparent nota-

Problem 12.16 The twin paradox revisited. On their 21st birthday, one twin gets
on a moving sidewalk, which carries her out to star X at speed 4

stays home. When the traveling twin gets to star X, she immediately jumps onto the
returning moving sidewalk and comes back to earth, again at speed 4

on her 39th birthday (as determined by her watch).

is S). All three systems choose their coordinates and set their master clocks such

that x = ¯ x = ˜ x = 0, t =

S, how must she
reset it immediately after the jump? What does her watch then read when she
gets home? (This wouldn’t change her age, of course—she’s still 39—it would
just make her watch agree with the standard synchronization in˜
S.)
(g) If the traveling twin is asked the question, “How old is your brother right now?”,
what is the correct reply (i) just before she makes the jump, (ii) just after she

makes the jump? (Nothing dramatic happens to her brother during the split
second between (i) and (ii), of course; what does change abruptly is his sister’s

where is the Lorentz transformation matrix in Eq. 12.24 (the superscript μ
labels the row, the subscript ν labels the column). One virtue of writing things
in this abstract manner is that we can handle in the same format a more general
transformation, in which the relative motion is not along a common x¯
x axis; the
matrix would be more complicated, but the structure of Eq. 12.25 is unchanged.
If this reminds you of the rotations we studied in Sect. 1.1.5, it’s no accident.
There we were concerned with the change in components when you switch to a
rotated coordinate system; here we are interested in the change of components
when you go to a moving system. In Chapter 1 we defined a (3-)vector as any set
of three components that transform under rotations the same way (x, y, z) do; by
extension, we now define a 4-vector as any set of four components that transform
in the same manner as (x0

There is a 4-vector analog to the dot product (A· B ≡ Ax Bx + Ay By + Az Bz ),
but it’s not just the sum of the products of like components; rather, the zeroth
components have a minus sign:
−a0b0 + a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3
. (12.28)
This is the four-dimensional scalar product; you should check for yourself
(Prob. 12.17) that it has the same value in all inertial systems:
−¯ a0¯
b0 + ¯ a1¯
b1 + ¯ a2¯
b2 + ¯ a3¯
b3
= −a0b0 + a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3; (12.29)
just as the ordinary dot product is invariant (unchanged) under rotations, this
combination is invariant under Lorentz transformations.
To keep track of the minus sign, it is convenient to introduce the covariant
vector aμ, which differs from the contravariant aμ only in the sign of the zeroth
component:
aμ = (a0,a1,a2,a3) ≡ (−a0
,a1
,a2
,a3). (12.30)
You must be scrupulously careful about the placement of indices in this business:
upper indices designate contravariant vectors; lower indices are for covariant

vectors. Raising or lowering the temporal index costs a minus sign (a0 = −a0);
raising or lowering a spatial index changes nothing (a1 = a1

The scalar product can now be written with the summation symbol,

aμbμ. (12.32)
(Summation is implied whenever a Greek index is repeated in a product—once as
a covariant index and once as contravariant. This is called the Einstein summa-
tion convention, after its inventor, who regarded it as one of his most important
contributions.) Of course, we could just as well take care of the minus sign by
switching to covariant b:
aμbμ = aμbμ = −a0b0 + a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3

Problem 12.17 Check Eq. 12.29, using Eq. 12.27. [This only proves the invariance
of the scalar product for transformations along the x direction. But the scalar product
is also invariant under rotations, since the first term is not affected at all, and the last
three constitute the three-dimensional dot product a· b. By a suitable rotation, the x
direction can be aimed any way you please, so the four-dimensional scalar product
is actually invariant under arbitrary Lorentz transformations.]
Problem 12.18
(a) Write out the matrix that describes a Galilean transformation (Eq. 12.12).
(b) Write out the matrix describing a Lorentz transformation along the y axis.
(c) Find the matrix describing a Lorentz transformation with velocity v along the
x axis followed by a Lorentz transformation with velocity¯
v along the y axis.
Does it matter in what order the transformations are carried out?
10It doesn’t matter whether you define the scalar product as in Eq. 12.28 (−a0b0 + a· b) or with an
overall minus sign (a0b0
− a· b); if one is invariant, so is the other. In the literature, both conventions
are common, and you just have to be aware of which one is in use. If they write the diagonal compo-
nents of the Minkowski metric as (−
, +, +,+), they are using the convention in Eq. 12.28; otherwise
they will write (+,−
,−
,−).

Problem 12.19 The parallel between rotations and Lorentz transformations is even
more striking if we introduce the rapidity:
θ ≡ tanh−1(v/c). (12.34)
(a) Express the Lorentz transformation matrix (Eq. 12.24) in terms of θ, and
compare it to the rotation matrix (Eq. 1.29).
In some respects, rapidity is a more natural way to describe motion than ve-
locity.11 For one thing, it ranges from −∞ to +∞, instead of−c to +c. More
significantly, rapidities add, whereas velocities do not.
(b) Express the Einstein velocity addition law in terms of rapidity.
(ii) The invariant interval. The scalar product of a 4-vector with itself,
aμaμ = −(a0)2 + (a1)2 + (a2)2 + (a3)2, can be positive (if the “spatial” terms
dominate) or negative (if the “temporal” term dominates) or zero:
If aμaμ > 0, aμ is called spacelike.
If aμaμ < 0, aμ is called timelike.
If aμaμ = 0, aμ is called lightlike.
Suppose event A occurs at (x0
A, x1
A, x2
A, x3
A), and event B at (x0
B , x1
B , x2
B , x3
B ).
The difference,
xμ ≡ xμ
A− xμ
B , (12.35)
is the displacement 4-vector. The scalar product of xμ with itself is called the
invariant interval between two events:
I ≡ (x)μ(x)μ = −(x0)2 + (x1)2 + (x2)2 + (x3)2
= −c2t2 + d2
,
(12.36)
where t is the time difference between the two events and d is their spatial sep-
aration. When you transform to a moving system, the time between A and B is
¯
altered (¯
t ̸= t), and so is the spatial separation (
d ̸= d), but the interval I remains
the same.
If the displacement between two events is timelike (I < 0), there exists an
inertial system (accessible by Lorentz transformation) in which they occur at the
same point. For if I hop on a train going from ( A) to (B) at the speed v = d/t,
leaving event A when it occurs, I shall be just in time to pass B when it occurs;
in the train system, A and B take place at the same point. You cannot do this for
a spacelike interval, of course, because v would have to be greater than c, and no
observer can exceed the speed of light (γ would be imaginary and the Lorentz
transformations would be nonsense). On the other hand, if the displacement is
spacelike (I > 0), then there exists a system in which the two events occur at the
same time (see Prob. 12.21). And if the displacement is lightlike (I= 0), then the
two events could be connected by a light signal.

Problem 12.20
(a) Event A happens at point (xA = 5, yA = 3, z A = 0) and at time tA given by
ctA = 15; event B occurs at (10, 8, 0) and ctB = 5, both in system S.
(i) What is the invariant interval between A and B?
(ii) Is there an inertial system in which they occur simultaneously? If so, find
its velocity (magnitude and direction) relative to S.
(iii) Is there an inertial system in which they occur at the same point? If so, find
its velocity relative to S.
(b) Repeat part (a) for A= (2, 0, 0),ct = 1; and B= (5, 0, 0),ct = 3.
Problem 12.21 The coordinates of event A are (x A , 0, 0),tA , and the coordinates of
event B are (xB , 0, 0),tB . Assuming the displacement between them is spacelike,
find the velocity of the system in which they are simultaneous.
(iii) Space-time diagrams. If you want to represent the motion of a particle
graphically, the normal practice is to plot the position versus time (that is, x runs
vertically and t horizontally). On such a graph, the velocity can be read off as the
slope of the curve. For some reason, the convention is reversed in relativity: every-
one plots position horizontally and time (or, better, x0 = ct) vertically. Velocity
is then given by the reciprocal of the slope. A particle at rest is represented by a
vertical line; a photon, traveling at the speed of light, is described by a 45◦ line;
and a rocket going at some intermediate speed follows a line of slope c/v= 1/β
(Fig. 12.21). We call such plots Minkowski diagrams.
The trajectory of a particle on a Minkowski diagram is called a world line.
Suppose you set out from the origin at time t = 0. Because no material object
can travel faster than light, your world line can never have a slope less than 1.
Accordingly, your motion is restricted to the wedge-shaped region bounded by
the two 45◦ lines (Fig. 12.22). We call this your “future,” in the sense that it is the

locus of all points accessible to you. Of course, as time goes on, and you move
along your chosen world line, your options progressively narrow: your “future”
at any moment is the forward “wedge” constructed at whatever point you find
yourself. Meanwhile, the backward wedge represents your “past,” in the sense
that it is the locus of all points from which you might have come. As for the
rest (the region outside the forward and backward wedges), this is the generalized
“present.” You can’t get there, and you didn’t come from there. In fact, there’s no
way you can influence any event in the present (the message would have to travel
faster than light); it’s a vast expanse of spacetime that is absolutely inaccessible
to you.
I’ve been ignoring the y and z directions. If we include a y axis coming out of
the page, the “wedges” become cones—and, with an undrawable z axis, hyper-
cones. Because their boundaries are the trajectories of light rays, we call them the
forward light cone and the backward light cone. Your future, in other words,
lies within your forward light cone, your past within your backward light cone.
Notice that the slope of the line connecting two events on a space-time dia-
gram tells you at a glance whether the displacement between them is timelike
(slope greater than 1), spacelike (slope less than 1), or lightlike (slope 1). For
example, all points in the past and future are timelike with respect to your present
location, whereas points in the present are spacelike, and points on the light cone
are lightlike.
Hermann Minkowski, who was the first to recognize the full geometrical sig-
nificance of special relativity, began a famous lecture in 1908 with the words,
“Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into
mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent
reality.”12 It’s a lovely thought, but you must be careful not to read too much into
it. For it is not at all the case that time is “just another coordinate, on the same
footing with x, y, and z” (except that for obscure reasons we measure it on clocks
instead of rulers). No: Time is utterly different from the others, and the mark of its
distinction is the minus sign in the invariant interval. That minus sign imparts to
spacetime a hyperbolic geometry that is much richer than the circular geometry
of 3-space.
Under rotations about the z axis, a point P in the x y plane describes a circle:
the locus of all points a fixed distance r = x2 + y2 from the origin (Fig. 12.23).
Under Lorentz transformations, however, it is the interval I= (x2
− c2t2) that is
preserved, and the locus of all points with a given value of I is a hyperbola—or,
if we include the y axis, a hyperboloid of revolution. When the displacement is
timelike, it’s a “hyperboloid of two sheets” (Fig. 12.24a); when the displacement
is spacelike, it’s a “hyperboloid of one sheet” (Fig. 12.24b). When you perform a
Lorentz transformation (that is, when you go into a moving inertial system), the
coordinates (x,t) of a given event will change to (¯
x,¯
t), but these new coordinates
will lie on the same hyperbola as (x,t). By appropriate combinations of Lorentz
transformations and rotations, a spot can be moved around at will over the surface

of a given hyperboloid, but no amount of transformation will carry it, say, from
the upper sheet of the timelike hyperboloid to the lower sheet, or to a spacelike
hyperboloid.
When we were discussing simultaneity, I showed that the time ordering of two
events can, at least in certain cases, be reversed, simply by going into a mov-
ing system. But we now see that this is not always possible: If the displacement
4-vector between two events is timelike, their ordering is absolute; if the interval
is spacelike, their ordering depends on the inertial system from which they are
observed. In terms of the space-time diagram, an event on the upper sheet of a
timelike hyperboloid definitely occurred after (0, 0), and one on the lower sheet
certainly occurred before; but an event on a spacelike hyperboloid occurred at
positive t, or negative t, depending on your reference frame. This is not an idle
curiosity, for it rescues the notion of causality, on which all physics is based. If
it were always possible to reverse the order of two events, then we could never
say “ A caused B,” since a rival observer would retort that B preceded A. This
embarrassment is avoided, provided the two events are timelike or lightlike sepa-
rated. And causally related events are—otherwise no influence could travel from
one to the other. Conclusion: The displacement between causally related events is
always timelike, and their temporal ordering is the same for all inertial observers.

12.2.1 12.2 RELATIVISTIC MECHANICS
Proper Time and Proper Velocity
As you progress along your world line, your watch runs slow; while the clock on
the wall ticks off an interval dt, your watch only advances dτ:
dτ = 1− u2/c2 dt. (12.37)
(I’ll use u for the velocity of a particular object—you, in this instance—and
reserve v for the relative velocity of two inertial systems.) The time τ your watch
registers (or, more generally, the time associated with the moving object) is called
proper time. (The word suggests a mistranslation of the French “propre”, mean-
ing “own.”) In some cases, τ may be a more relevant or useful quantity than t.
For one thing, proper time is invariant, whereas “ordinary” time depends on the
particular reference frame you have in mind.
12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 533
Now, imagine you’re on a flight to Los Angeles, and the pilot announces that
the plane’s velocity is 4
5 c. What precisely does he mean by “velocity”? Well, of
course, he means the displacement divided by the time:
dl
u =
dt, (12.38)
and, since he is presumably talking about the velocity relative to ground, both dl
and dt are to be measured by the ground observer. That’s the important number to
know, if you’re concerned about being on time for an appointment in Los Angeles,
but if you’re wondering whether you’ll be hungry on arrival, you might be more
interested in the distance covered per unit proper time:
η ≡
dl
dτ
. (12.39)
This hybrid quantity (distance measured on the ground, over time measured in the
airplane) is called proper velocity; for contrast, I’ll call u the ordinary velocity.
The two are related by Eq. 12.37:
η=
1
1− u2/c2
u. (12.40)
For speeds much less than c, of course, the difference between ordinary and proper
velocity is negligible.
From a theoretical standpoint, however, proper velocity has an enormous ad-
vantage over ordinary velocity: it transforms simply, when you go from one iner-
tial system to another. In fact, η is the spatial part of a 4-vector,

The reason for the added complexity is plain: we’re obliged to transform both the

alone.

12.2.2 Relativistic Energy and Momentum
In classical mechanics, momentum is mass times velocity. I would like to ex-
tend this definition to the relativistic domain, but immediately a question arises:
Should I use ordinary velocity or proper velocity? In classical physics, η and u
are identical, so there is no a priori reason to favor one over the other. However,
in the context of relativity it is essential that we use proper velocity, for the law of
conservation of momentum would be inconsistent with the principle of relativity
if we were to define momentum as mu (see Prob. 12.29). Thus
p ≡ mη=
mu
1− u2/c2 ; (12.46)
this is the relativistic momentum of an object of mass m traveling at (ordinary)
velocity u.
13
Relativistic momentum is the spatial part of a 4-vector,
pμ ≡ mημ
, (12.47)
13Older treatments introduce the so-called relativistic mass, mr ≡ m/ 1− u2/c2, so p can be writ-
ten as mr u, but this unhelpful extra terminology has gone the way of the two-dollar bill.
536 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity
and it is natural to ask what the temporal component,
p0
= mη0
=
mc
1− u2/c2 (12.48)
represents. Einstein identified p0c as relativistic energy:
E ≡
mc2
1− u2/c2 ; (12.49)
pμ is called the energy-momentum 4-vector (or the momentum 4-vector, for
short).
Notice that the relativistic energy is nonzero even when the object is stationary;
we call this rest energy:
Erest ≡ mc2
. (12.50)
The remainder, which is attributable to the motion, is kinetic energy
Ekin ≡ E− mc2
= mc2 1
1− u2/c2
− 1 . (12.51)
In the nonrelativistic régime (u ≪ c) the square root can be expanded in powers
of u2/c2, giving
3
Ekin =
1
2
mu2 +
8
mu4
c2 + · · · ; (12.52)
the leading term reproduces the classical formula.
So far, this is all just notation. The physics resides in the experimental fact that
E and p, as defined by Eqs. 12.46 and 12.49, are conserved:
In every closed14 system, the total relativistic energy and momen-
tum are conserved.
Mass is not conserved—a fact that has been painfully familiar to everyone since
1945 (though the so-called “conversion of mass into energy” is really a conversion
of rest energy into kinetic energy).
Note the distinction between an invariant quantity (same value in all inertial
systems) and a conserved quantity (same value before and after some process).
Mass is invariant but not conserved; energy is conserved but not invariant; electric
charge is both conserved and invariant; velocity is neither conserved nor invariant.
The scalar product of pμ with itself is
pμ pμ = −(p0)2 + (p· p)= −m2c2
, (12.53)
14If there are external forces at work, then (just as in the classical case) the energy and momentum of
the system itself will not, in general, be conserved.
12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 537
as you can quickly check using the result of Prob. 12.26. In terms of the relativistic
energy and momentum,
E2
− p2c2
= m2c4
. (12.54)
This result is extremely useful, for it enables you to calculate E (if you know
p ≡ |p|), or p (knowing E), without ever having to determine the velocity.15
Problem 12.29
(a) Repeat Prob. 12.2(a) using the (incorrect) definition p= mu, but with the (cor-
rect) Einstein velocity addition rule. Notice that if momentum (so defined) is
conserved in S, it is not conserved in¯
S. Assume all motion is along the x axis.

(so defined) is conserved in S, it is automatically also conserved in¯
S. [Hint:

In this section we’ll explore some applications of the conservation laws.
Example 12.7. lump?
Two lumps of clay, each of (rest) mass m, collide head-on at 3

(Fig. 12.26). They stick together. Question: what is the mass (M) of the composite

15Equations 12.53 and 12.54 apply to a single particle of mass m. If you’re talking about the total
energy and momentum of a collection of particles, pμ pμ is still an invariant, and you can use it to
define the so-called invariant mass (−pμ pμ/c2) of the system, but this will not (in general) be the
sum of the individual masses.
538 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity
Solution
In this case conservation of momentum is trivial: zero before, zero after. The
energy of each lump prior to the collision is
mc2
1− (3/5)2
=
mc2
,
and the energy of the composite lump after the collision is Mc2 (since it’s at rest).
So conservation of energy says

and hence

Notice that this is greater than the sum of the initial masses! Mass was not con-
served in this collision; kinetic energy was converted into rest energy, so the mass
increased.
In the classical analysis of such a collision, we say that kinetic energy was
converted into thermal energy—the composite lump is hotter than the two col-
liding pieces. This is, of course, true in the relativistic picture too. But what is
thermal energy? It’s the sum total of the random kinetic and potential energies of
all the atoms and molecules in the substance. Relativity tells us that these internal
energies are represented in the mass of the composite object: a hot potato is heav-
ier than a cold potato, and a compressed spring is heavier than a relaxed spring.
Not by much, it’s true—internal energy (U ) contributes an amount U/c2 to the
mass, and c2 is a very large number by everyday standards. You could never get
two lumps of clay going anywhere near fast enough to detect the nonconservation
of mass in their collision. But in the realm of elementary particles, the effect can
be very striking. For example, when the neutral pi meson (mass 2.4 × 10−28 kg)
decays into an electron and a positron (each of mass 9.11 × 10−31 kg), the rest
energy is converted almost entirely into kinetic energy—less than 1% of the orig-
inal mass remains.
In classical mechanics, there’s no such thing as a massless (m = 0) particle—
its kinetic energy (1
2 mu2) and its momentum (mu) would be zero, you couldn’t
apply a force to it (F= ma), and hence (by Newton’s third law) it couldn’t ex-
ert a force on anything else—it’s a cipher, as far as physics is concerned. You
might at first assume that the same is true in relativity; after all, p and E are still
proportional to m. However, a closer inspection of Eqs. 12.46 and 12.49 reveals
a loophole worthy of a congressman: If u = c, then the zero in the numerator
is balanced by a zero in the denominator, leaving p and E indeterminate (zero
over zero). It is just conceivable, therefore, that a massless particle could carry
energy and momentum, provided it always travels at the speed of light. Although
12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 539
Eqs. 12.46 and 12.49 would no longer suffice to determine E and p, Eq. 12.54
suggests that the two should be related by
E= pc. (12.55)
Personally, I would regard this argument as a joke, were it not for the fact that
at least one massless particle is known to exist in nature: the photon.16 Photons do
travel at the speed of light, and they obey Eq. 12.55.17 They force us to take the
“loophole” seriously. (By the way, you might ask what distinguishes a photon with
a lot of energy from one with very little—after all, they have the same mass (zero)
and the same speed (c). Relativity offers no answer to this question; curiously,
quantum mechanics does: According to the Planck formula, E= hν, where h is
Planck’s constant and ν is the frequency. A blue photon is more energetic than a
red one!)
Example 12.8. A pion at rest decays into a muon and a neutrino (Fig. 12.27).
Find the energy of the outgoing muon, in terms of the two masses, mπ and mμ
(assume mν = 0).

FIGURE 12.27
Solution
In this case,
Ebefore = mπ c2
, pbefore = 0,
Eafter = Eμ + Eν, pafter = pμ + pν.
Conservation of momentum requires that pν = −pμ. Conservation of energy says
that
Eμ + Eν = mπ c2
.
Now, Eν = |pν|c, by Eq. 12.55, whereas |pμ| = E2

16Until recently, neutrinos were also assumed to be massless, but experiments in 1998 indicate that
they in fact carry a (very small) mass.
17The photon is the quantum of the electromagnetic field, and it is no accident that the same ratio
between energy and momentum holds for electromagnetic waves (see Eqs. 9.60 and 9.62).

In a classical collision, momentum and mass are always conserved, whereas
kinetic energy, in general, is not. A “sticky” collision generates heat at the expense
of kinetic energy; an “explosive” collision generates kinetic energy at the expense
of chemical energy (or some other kind). If the kinetic energy is conserved, as
in the ideal collision of the two billiard balls, we call the process “elastic.” In
the relativistic case, momentum and total energy are always conserved, but mass
and kinetic energy, in general, are not. Once again, we call the process elastic if
kinetic energy is conserved. In such a case the rest energy (being the total minus
the kinetic) is also conserved, and therefore so too is the mass. In practice, this
means that the same particles come out as went in. Examples 12.7 and 12.8 were
inelastic processes; the next one is elastic.
Example 12.9. Compton scattering. A photon of energy E0 “bounces” off an
electron, initially at rest. Find the energy E of the outgoing photon, as a function
of the scattering angle θ (see Fig. 12.28).

Problem 12.32 Find the velocity of the muon in Ex. 12.8.
Problem 12.33 A particle of mass m whose total energy is twice its rest energy
collides with an identical particle at rest. If they stick together, what is the mass of
the resulting composite particle? What is its velocity?
Problem 12.34 A neutral pion of (rest) mass m and (relativistic) momentum p=

4 mc decays into two photons. One of the photons is emitted in the same direction
as the original pion, and the other in the opposite direction. Find the (relativistic)
energy of each photon.
Problem 12.35 In the past, most experiments in particle physics involved stationary
targets: one particle (usually a proton or an electron) was accelerated to a high
energy E, and collided with a target particle at rest (Fig. 12.29a). Far higher relative
energies are obtainable (with the same accelerator) if you accelerate both particles to
energy E, and fire them at each other (Fig. 12.29b). Classically, the energy¯
E of one
particle, relative to the other, is just 4E (why?) . . . not much of a gain (only a factor
of 4). But relativistically the gain can be enormous. Assuming the two particles have
the same mass, m, show that

What multiple of E does this amount to? (1 GeV=109 electron volts.) [Because of
this relativistic enhancement, most modern elementary particle experiments involve
colliding beams, instead of fixed targets.]
Problem 12.36 In a pair annihilation experiment, an electron (mass m) with mo-
mentum pe hits a positron (same mass, but opposite charge) at rest. They annihilate,
producing two photons. (Why couldn’t they produce just one photon?) If one of the
photons emerges at 60◦ to the incident electron direction, what is its energy?

Newton’s first law is built into the principle of relativity. His second law, in the
F=

retains its validity in relativistic mechanics, provided we use the relativistic mo-
mentum.
Example 12.10. Motion under a constant force. A particle of mass m is subject
to a constant force F. If it starts from rest at the origin, at time t = 0, find its
position (x), as a function of time.
Solution
d p
dt= F ⇒ p= Ft + constant,
but since p= 0 at t = 0, the constant must be zero, and hence
p=
mu
1− u2/c2
= Ft.
Solving for u, we obtain
u =
(F/m)t
1 + (Ft/mc)2. (12.60)
The numerator, of course, is the classical answer—it’s approximately right, if
(F/m)t ≪ c. But the relativistic denominator ensures that u never exceeds c; in
fact, as t → ∞,u → c.

In place of the classical parabola, x(t)= (F/2m)t2, the graph is a hyperbola
(Fig. 12.30); for this reason, motion under a constant force is often called
hyperbolic motion. It occurs, for example, when a charged particle is placed
in a uniform electric field.

(Since the rest energy is constant, it doesn’t matter whether we use the total en-
ergy, here, or the kinetic energy.)
Unlike the first two, Newton’s third law does not, in general, extend to the
relativistic domain. Indeed, if the two objects in question are separated in space,
the third law is incompatible with the relativity of simultaneity. For suppose the
force of A on B at some instant t is F(t), and the force of B on A at the same in-
stant is−F(t); then the third law applies in this reference frame. But a moving
observer will report that these equal and opposite forces occurred at different
times; in his system, therefore, the third law is violated. Only in the case of con-
tact interactions, where the two forces are applied at the same physical point (and
in the trivial case where the forces are constant) can the third law be retained.
Because F is the derivative of momentum with respect to ordinary time, it
shares the ugly behavior of (ordinary) velocity, when you go from one inertial
system to another: both the numerator and the denominator must be transformed.

That is, the component of F parallel to the motion of¯
S is unchanged, whereas
perpendicular components are divided by γ.
It has perhaps occurred to you that we could avoid the bad transformation
behavior of F by introducing a “proper” force, analogous to proper velocity, which
would be the derivative of momentum with respect to proper time:
d pμ
K μ ≡
. (12.68)
This is called the Minkowski force; it is plainly a 4-vector, since pμ is a 4-vector
and proper time is invariant. The spatial components of K μ are related to the
“ordinary” force by

is, apart from the 1/c, the (proper) rate at which the energy of the particle
increases—in other words, the (proper) power delivered to the particle.
Relativistic dynamics can be formulated in terms of the ordinary force or in
terms of the Minkowski force. The latter is generally much neater, but since in
the long run we are interested in the particle’s trajectory as a function of ordinary
time, the former is often more useful. When we wish to generalize some classical
force law, such as Lorentz’s, to the relativistic domain, the question arises: Does
the classical formula correspond to the ordinary force or to the Minkowski force?
In other words, should we write
F= q(E + u × B),
or should it rather be
K= q(E + u × B)?
Since proper time and ordinary time are identical in classical physics, there is
no way at this stage to decide the issue. The Lorentz force, as it turns out, is an
ordinary force—later on I’ll explain why this is so, and show you how to construct
the electromagnetic Minkowski force.
Example 12.11. The typical trajectory of a charged particle in a uniform mag-
netic field is cyclotron motion (Fig. 12.31). The magnetic force pointing toward
the center,

provides the centripetal acceleration necessary to sustain circular motion. Beware,
however—in special relativity the centripetal force is not mu2/R, as in classical
mechanics. Rather, as you can see from Fig. 12.32, d p= p dθ, so

(Classically, of course, p= mu, so F= mu2/R.) Thus,

or
p= Q B R. (12.71)
In this form, the relativistic cyclotron formula is identical to the nonrelativistic
one, Eq. 5.3—the only difference is that p is now the relativistic momentum.
In classical mechanics, the total momentum (P) of a collection of interacting
particles can be expressed as the total mass (M) times the velocity of the center-
of-mass:
E
dRm
P= M
dt.
In relativity the center-of-mass (Rm =

energy (Re =

E Ei ri , where E is the total energy), and M by E/c2:
P=

dt. (12.72)
P now includes all forms of momentum, and E all forms of energy—not just
mechanical, but also whatever may be stored in the fields.19
19The proof of Eq. 12.72 is not trivial. See S. Coleman and J. H. Van Vleck, Phys. Rev. 171, 1370
(1968) or M. G. Calkin, Am. J. Phys. 39, 513 (1971).

Example 12.12. In Example 8.3 we found that the momentum stored in the
fields of a coaxial cable is not zero, even though the cable itself is at rest. At
the time, this seemed paradoxical. However, energy is being transported, from
the battery to the resistor, and hence the center-of-energy is in motion. Indeed, if
the battery is at z = 0, so the resistor is at z = l, then Re = (E0R0 + E Rlˆ
z)/E,
where E R is the energy in the resistor, E0 is the rest of the energy, and R0 is the
center-of-energy of E0, so

According to Eq. 12.72, then, the total momentum should be

which is exactly the momentum in the fields, as calculated in Example 8.3.
If this still seems strange to you, imagine a shoe-box, with a marble inside that
we cannot see. The box is at rest, but the marble is rolling from one end to the
other. Is there momentum in this system? Yes, of course, even though the box is
stationary—there is the momentum of the marble. In the case of the coaxial cable,
no actual object is in motion (well, the electrons are, but there are just as many of
them going one way as the other, and their net momentum is zero), but energy is
flowing from one end to the other, and in relativity all forms of energy in motion,
not just rest energy (mass), constitute momentum. The “marble” (in this analogy)
is the electromagnetic field, which transports energy, and therefore contributes
momentum . . . even though the fields themselves are perfectly static! 20
In the following example, the center of energy is at rest, so the total momentum
must be zero (Eq. 12.72). But the (static) electromagnetic fields do carry momen-
tum, and the problem is to locate the compensating mechanical momentum.
Example 12.13. As a model for a magnetic dipole m, consider a rectangular
loop of wire carrying a steady current I . Picture the current as a stream of non-
interacting positive charges that move freely within the wire. When a uniform
electric field E is applied (Fig. 12.33), the charges accelerate in the left segment
and decelerate in the right one.21 Find the total momentum of all the charges in
the loop.
Solution
The momenta of the left and right segments cancel, so we need only consider the
top and the bottom. Say there are N+ charges in the top segment, going at speed
20This problem was incorrectly analyzed in the third edition—see T. H. Boyer, Am. J. Phys. 76, 190
(2008).
21This is not a very realistic model for a current-carrying wire, obviously, but other models lead to
exactly the same result. See V. Hnizdo, Am. J. Phys. 65, 92 (1997).

Thus a magnetic dipole at rest in an electric field carries linear momentum, even
though it is not moving! This so-called hidden momentum is strictly relativistic,
and purely mechanical; it precisely cancels the electromagnetic momentum stored
in the fields (Eq. 8.45).22

12.3 RELATIVISTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS
Magnetism as a Relativistic Phenomenon
Unlike Newtonian mechanics, classical electrodynamics is already consistent
with special relativity. Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force law can be ap-
plied legitimately in any inertial system. Of course, what one observer interprets
as an electrical process another may regard as magnetic, but the actual particle
motions they predict will be identical. To the extent that this did not work out
for Lorentz and others, who studied the question in the late nineteenth century,
the fault lay with the nonrelativistic mechanics they used, not with the electro-
dynamics. Having corrected Newtonian mechanics, we are now in a position to
develop a complete and consistent formulation of relativistic electrodynamics.
I emphasize that we will not be changing the rules of electrodynamics in the
slightest—rather, we will be expressing these rules in a notation that exposes and
illuminates their relativistic character. As we go along, I shall pause now and then
to rederive, using the Lorentz transformations, results obtained earlier by more
laborious means. But the main purpose of this section is to provide you with a
deeper understanding of the structure of electrodynamics—laws that had seemed
arbitrary and unrelated before take on a kind of coherence and inevitability when
approached from the point of view of relativity.
To begin with, I’d like to show you why there had to be such a thing as mag-
netism, given electrostatics and relativity, and how, in particular, you can calculate
the magnetic force between a current-carrying wire and a moving charge with-
out ever invoking the laws of magnetism.23 Suppose you had a string of positive
charges moving along to the right at speed v. I’ll assume the charges are close
enough together so that we may treat them as a continuous line charge λ. Super-
imposed on this positive string is a negative one,−λ proceeding to the left at the
same speed v. We have, then, a net current to the right, of magnitude
I= 2λv. (12.76)
Meanwhile, a distance s away there is a point charge q traveling to the right
at speed u < v (Fig. 12.34a). Because the two line charges cancel, there is no
electrical force on q in this system (S).
However, let’s examine the same situation from the point of view of system¯
S,
which moves to the right with speed u (Fig. 12.34b). In this reference frame, q
is at rest. By the Einstein velocity addition rule, the velocities of the positive and
negative lines are now
v± =
v ∓ u
1 ∓ vu/c2. (12.77)

Because v− is greater than v+, the Lorentz contraction of the spacing between
negative charges is more severe than that between positive charges; in this frame,
therefore, the wire carries a net negative charge! In fact,
λ± = ±(γ±)λ0, (12.78)
where
γ± =
1
1− v2
±/c2
, (12.79)
and λ0 is the charge density of the positive line in its own rest system. That’s not
the same as λ, of course—in S they’re already moving at speed v, so
λ= γλ0, (12.80)
where
γ=
1
1− v2/c2. (12.81)
552 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity
It takes some algebra to put γ± into simple form:

1− u2/c2. (12.82)
= λ0(γ+− γ−)=
−2λuv
c2 1− u2/c2. (12.83)
Conclusion: As a result of unequal Lorentz contraction of the positive and nega-
tive lines, a current-carrying wire that is electrically neutral in one inertial system
will be charged in another.
Now, a line charge λtot sets up an electric field
E=
λtot

,
so there is an electrical force on q in¯
S, to wit:
¯
λv
F= q E= −
πϵ0c2s
qu
1− u2/c2. (12.84)
But if there’s a force on q in¯
S, there must be one in S; in fact, we can calculate
it by using the transformation rules for forces. Since q is at rest in¯
S, and¯
F is
perpendicular to u, the force in S is given by Eq. 12.67:
λv
F= 1− u2/c2¯
F= −
πϵ0c2
qu
s. (12.85)
S
The charge is attracted toward the wire by a force that is purely electrical in¯
(where the wire is charged, and q is at rest), but distinctly nonelectrical in S
(where the wire is neutral). Taken together, then, electrostatics and relativity im-
ply the existence of another force. This “other force” is, of course, magnetic. In
fact, we can cast Eq. 12.85 into more familiar form by using c2 = (ϵ0μ0)−1 and
expressing λv in terms of the current (Eq. 12.76):
F= −qu
μ0 I
2πs. (12.86)
The term in parentheses is the magnetic field of a long straight wire, and the
force is precisely what we would have obtained by using the Lorentz force law in
system S.

12.3.2 How the Fields Transform
We have learned, in various special cases, that one observer’s electric field is
another’s magnetic field. It would be nice to know the general transformation
rules for electromagnetic fields: Given the fields in S, what are the fields in¯
S?
Your first guess might be that E is the spatial part of one 4-vector and B the
spatial part of another. But your guess would be wrong—it’s more complicated
than that. Let me begin by making explicit an assumption that was already used
implicitly in Sect. 12.3.1: Charge is invariant. Like mass, but unlike energy, the
charge of a particle is a fixed number, independent of how fast it happens to be
moving. We shall assume also that the transformation rules are the same no matter
how the fields were produced—electric fields associated with changing magnetic
fields transform the same way as those set up by stationary charges. Were this
not the case we’d have to abandon the field formulation altogether, for it is the
essence of a field theory that the fields at a given point tell you all there is to know,
electromagnetically, about that point; you do not have to append extra information
regarding their source.
With this in mind, consider the simplest possible electric field: the uni-
form field in the region between the plates of a large parallel-plate capacitor
(Fig. 12.35a). Say the capacitor is at rest in S0 and carries surface charges ±σ0.
Then

554 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity
What if we examine this same capacitor from system S, moving to the right at
speed v0 (Fig. 12.35b)? In this system the plates are moving to the left, but the
field still takes the form
σ
E=
ˆ
y; (12.88)
ϵ0
the only difference is the value of the surface charge σ. [Wait a minute! Is that the
only difference? The formula E= σ/ϵ0 for a parallel plate capacitor came from
Gauss’s law, and whereas Gauss’s law is perfectly valid for moving charges, this
application also relies on symmetry. Are we sure that the field is still perpendicular
to the plates? What if the field of a moving plane tilts, say, along the direction of
motion, as in Fig. 12.35c? Well, even if it did (it doesn’t), the field between the
plates, being the superposition of the +σ field and the−σ field, would still run
perpendicular to the plates (changing the sign of the charge reverses the direction
of the field, and the vector sum kills off the parallel components).]
Now, the total charge on each plate is invariant, and the width (w) is un-
changed, but the length (l) is Lorentz-contracted by a factor of
γ0 =
1
1− v2
0 /c2
, (12.89)
so the charge per unit area is increased by a factor of γ0:
σ = γ0σ0. (12.90)
Accordingly,
E⊥
= γ0E0
⊥
. (12.91)
I have put in the superscript ⊥ to make it clear that this rule pertains to com-
ponents of E that are perpendicular to the direction of motion of S. To get the
rule for parallel components, consider the capacitor lined up with the y z plane

FIGURE 12.36

(Fig. 12.36). This time it is the plate separation (d) that is Lorentz-contracted,
whereas l and w (and hence also σ) are the same in both frames. Since the field
does not depend on d, it follows that
E∥ = E0∥
. (12.92)
Example 12.14. Electric field of a point charge in uniform motion. A point
charge q is at rest at the origin in system S0. Question: What is the electric field

This, then, is the field of a charge in uniform motion; we got the same result in
Chapter 10 using the retarded potentials (Eq. 10.75). The present derivation is far
more efficient, and sheds some light on the remarkable fact that the field points
away from the instantaneous (as opposed to the retarded) position of the charge:
Ex gets a factor of γ0 from the Lorentz transformation of the coordinates; Ey and
Ez pick up theirs from the transformation of the field. It’s the balancing of these
two γ0’s that leaves E parallel to R.
But Eqs. 12.91 and 12.92 are not the most general transformation laws, for we
began with a system S0 in which the charges were at rest and where, consequently,
there was no magnetic field. To derive the general rule, we must start out in a
system with both electric and magnetic fields. For this purpose S itself will serve
nicely. In addition to the electric field
σ
Ey =

there is a magnetic field due to the surface currents (Fig. 12.35b):
K± = ∓σv0ˆ

By the right-hand rule, this field points in the negative z direction; its magnitude
is given by Ampère’s law (Ex. 5.8):

This tells us how Ey and Bz transform—to do Ez and By , we simply align the

As for the x components, we have already seen (by orienting the capacitor
parallel to the yz plane) that
¯
Ex = Ex. (12.105)
Since in this case there is no accompanying magnetic field, we cannot deduce the
transformation rule for Bx . But another configuration will do the job: Imagine
a long solenoid aligned parallel to the x axis (Fig. 12.40) and at rest in S. The
magnetic field within the coil is
Bx = μ0n I, (12.106)

where n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current. In system¯

the length contracts, so n increases:

runs slow, so the current (charge per unit time) in¯
S is given by

The two factors of γ exactly cancel, and we conclude that

Bx = Bx.
Like E, the component of B parallel to the motion is unchanged.

In other words, if either E or B is zero (at a particular point) in one system, then
in any other system the fields (at that point) are very simply related by Eq. 12.110
or Eq. 12.111.
Example 12.15. Magnetic field of a point charge in uniform motion. Find the
magnetic field of a point charge q moving at constant velocity v.

12.3.3 The Field Tensor
As Eq. 12.109 indicates, E and B certainly do not transform like the spatial parts
of the two 4-vectors—in fact, the components of E and B are stirred together
when you go from one inertial system to another. What sort of an object is this,
which has six components and transforms according to Eq. 12.109? Answer: It’s
an antisymmetric, second-rank tensor.
Remember that a 4-vector transforms by the rule

aμ = μ

0 0 0 1
⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠, (12.114)
and μ
ν is the entry in row μ, column ν. A (second-rank) tensor is an object with
two indices, which transforms with two factors of (one for each index):
¯
tμν =
μ
λ
ν
σ tλσ
. (12.115)
A tensor (in 4 dimensions) has 4 × 4= 16 components, which we can display in
a 4 × 4 array:
tμν =
⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩
t00 t01 t02 t03
t10 t11 t12 t13
t20 t21 t22 t23
t30 t31 t32 t33
⎫ ⎪ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎪ ⎭.
However, the 16 elements need not all be different. For instance, a symmetric
tensor has the property
tμν = tνμ (symmetric tensor). (12.116)
In this case there are 10 distinct components; 6 of the 16 are repeats (t01 =
t10
, t02 = t20
, t03 = t30
, t12 = t21
, t13 = t31
, t23 = t32). Similarly, an
antisymmetric tensor obeys
tμν = −tνμ (antisymmetric tensor). (12.117)
Such an object has just 6 distinct elements—of the original 16, six are repeats
(the same ones as before, only this time with a minus sign) and four are zero
(t00
, t11
,t22
, and t33). Thus, the general antisymmetric tensor has the form
tμν =

Thus relativity completes and perfects the job begun by Oersted, combining the
electric and magnetic fields into a single entity, Fμν
.
If you followed that argument with exquisite care, you may have noticed that
there was a different way of imbedding E and B in an antisymmetric tensor: In-
stead of comparing the first line of Eq. 12.109 with the first line of Eq. 12.118,
and the second with the second, we could relate the first line of Eq. 12.109 to the
second line of Eq. 12.118, and vice versa. This leads to dual tensor, Gμν:
Gμν =

Gμν can be obtained directly from Fμν by the substitution E/c → B, B →
−E/c. Notice that this operation leaves Eq. 12.109 unchanged—that’s why both
tensors generate the correct transformation rules for E and B.

Problem 12.51 Recall that a covariant 4-vector is obtained from a contravariant
one by changing the sign of the zeroth component. The same goes for tensors: When
you “lower an index” to make it covariant, you change the sign if that index is zero.

12.3.4 Electrodynamics in Tensor Notation
Now that we know how to represent the fields in relativistic notation, it is time
to reformulate the laws of electrodynamics (Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz
force law) in that language. To begin with, we must determine how the sources of
the fields, ρ and J, transform. Imagine a cloud of charge drifting by; we concen-
trate on an infinitesimal volume V , which contains charge Q moving at velocity
u (Fig. 12.43). The charge density is
Q
ρ =
V,
and the current density26 is
J= ρu.
I would like to express these quantities in terms of the proper charge density ρ0,
the density in the rest system of the charge:
Q
ρ0 =
,
V0
u
V
Q
FIGURE 12.43
26I’m assuming all the charge in V is of one sign, and it all goes at the same speed. If not, you have to
treat the constituents separately: J= ρ+u+ + ρ−u−. But the argument is the same.
566 Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity
where V0 is the rest volume of the cloud. Because one dimension (the one along
the direction of motion) is Lorentz-contracted,
V= 1− u2/c2 V0, (12.121)
and hence
ρ = ρ0
1
1− u2/c2 , J= ρ0
u
1− u2/c2. (12.122)
Comparing this with Eqs. 12.40 and 12.42, we recognize here the components
of proper velocity, multiplied by the invariant ρ0. Evidently charge density and
current density go together to make a 4-vector:
J μ = ρ0ημ
, (12.123)
whose components are
∂ρ
We’ll call it the current density 4-vector.
The continuity equation (Eq. 5.29),
J μ = (cρ, Jx , Jy , Jz ). ∇· J= −
,
(12.124)
expressing the local conservation of charge, takes on a nice compact form when
written in terms of J μ. For

Thus, bringing ∂ρ/∂t over to the left side (in the continuity equation), we have:
∂ J μ
= 0, (12.126)
∂xμ
with summation over μ implied. Incidentally, ∂ J μ/∂xμ is the four-dimensional
divergence of J μ, so the continuity equation states that the current density
4-vector is divergenceless.

which is Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s correction.

and therefore, referring back to Eq. 12.69,
F= q[E + (u × B)],
which is the Lorentz force law. Equation 12.128, then, represents the Lorentz
force law in relativistic notation. I’ll leave for you the interpretation of the zeroth
component (Prob. 12.55).
Problem 12.53 Obtain the continuity equation (Eq. 12.126) directly from Maxwell’s
equations (Eq. 12.127).

Problem 12.55 Work out, and interpret physically, the μ = 0 component of the
electromagnetic force law, Eq. 12.128.
12.3.5 Relativistic Potentials
From Chapter 10, we know that the electric and magnetic fields can be expressed
in terms of a scalar potential V and a vector potential A:
E= −∇V−
∂A
∂t
, B= ∇ × A. (12.131)
As you might guess, V and A together constitute a 4-vector:
Aμ = (V /c, Ax , Ay , Az ). (12.132)
In terms of this 4-vector potential, the field tensor can be written
Fμν =
∂ Aν
∂xμ
−
∂ Aμ
∂xν
. (12.133)
(Observe that the differentiation is with respect to the covariant vectors xμ and
xν; remember, that changes the sign of the zeroth component: x0 = −x0. See
Prob. 12.56.)
To check that Eq. 12.133 is equivalent to Eq. 12.131, let’s evaluate a few terms
explicitly. For μ = 0,ν = 1,
∂ A1

That (and its companions with ν = 2 and ν = 3) is the first equation in Eq. 12.131.
For μ = 1, ν = 2, we get

∂x1

∂ Ax
∂y= (∇ × A)z = Bz ,
which (together with the corresponding results for F23 and F31) is the second
equation in Eq. 12.131.
The potential formulation automatically takes care of the homogeneous Max-
well equation (∂Gμν/∂xν = 0). As for the inhomogeneous equation (∂Fμν/∂xν =
μ0 J μ), that becomes
∂

. (12.134)

This is an intractable equation as it stands. However, you will recall that the poten-
tials are not uniquely determined by the fields—in fact, it’s clear from Eq. 12.133
that you could add to Aμ the gradient of any scalar function λ:
∂λ
Aμ −→ Aμ′
= Aμ +
, (12.135)
∂xμ
without changing Fμν. This is precisely the gauge invariance we noted in
Chapter 10; we can exploit it to simplify Eq. 12.134. In particular, the Lorenz
gauge condition (Eq. 10.12)
1
∂V
∇· A= −
c2
∂t
becomes, in relativistic notation,
∂ Aμ
= 0. (12.136)

2 Aμ = −μ0 J μ

Equation 12.137 combines our previous results into a single 4-vector equation—it
represents the most elegant formulation of Maxwell’s equations.27
Problem 12.56 You may have noticed that the four-dimensional gradient operator
∂/∂xμ functions like a covariant 4-vector—in fact, it is often written ∂μ, for short.
For instance, the continuity equation, ∂μ J μ = 0, has the form of an invariant product
of two vectors. The corresponding contravariant gradient would be ∂μ ≡ ∂/∂xμ.
Prove that ∂μφ is a (contravariant) 4-vector, if φ is a scalar function, by working out
its transformation law, using the chain rule.
Problem 12.57 Show that the potential representation (Eq. 12.133) automatically
satisfies ∂Gμν/∂xν = 0. [Suggestion: Use Prob. 12.54.]
Problem 12.58 Show that the Liénard-Wiechert potentials (Eqs. 10.46 and 10.47)
can be expressed in relativistic notation as
q
Aμ = −
ημ
4πϵ0c
(ηνrν),
where rμ ≡ xμ − wμ(tr ).
27Incidentally, the Coulomb gauge is bad, from the point of view of relativity, because its defining
condition, ∇· A= 0, is destroyed by Lorentz transformation. To restore this condition, it is necessary
to perform an appropriate gauge transformation every time you go to a new inertial system, in addition
to the Lorentz transformation itself. In this sense, Aμ is not a true 4-vector, in the Coulomb gauge.

A Vector Calculus in Curvilinear
Coordinates
A.1 INTRODUCTION
In this Appendix I sketch proofs of the three fundamental theorems of vector
calculus. My aim is to convey the essence of the argument, not to track down every
epsilon and delta. A much more elegant, modern, and unified—but necessarily
also much longer—treatment will be found in M. Spivak’s book, Calculus on
Manifolds (New York: Benjamin, 1965).
For the sake of generality, I shall use arbitrary (orthogonal) curvilinear co-
ordinates (u,v,w), developing formulas for the gradient, divergence, curl, and
Laplacian in any such system. You can then specialize them to Cartesian, spheri-
cal, or cylindrical coordinates, or any other system you might wish to use. If the
generality bothers you on a first reading, and you’d rather stick to Cartesian co-
ordinates, just read (x, y, z) wherever you see (u,v,w), and make the associated
simplifications as you go along.
A.2 NOTATION
We identify a point in space by its three coordinates, u,v, and w (in the Carte-
sian system, (x, y, z); in the spherical system, (r,θ,φ); in the cylindrical system,
(s,φ, z)). I shall assume the system is orthogonal, in the sense that the three unit
ˆ
ˆ
vectors,
u,
v, andˆ
w, pointing in the direction of the increase of the corresponding
coordinates, are mutually perpendicular. Note that the unit vectors are functions
of position, since their directions (except in the Cartesian case) vary from point to
point. Any vector can be expressed in terms ofˆ
ˆ
u,
v, andˆ
w—in particular, the in-
finitesimal displacement vector from (u,v,w) to (u + du,v + dv,w + dw) can
be written
dl= f duˆ
u + g dvˆ
v + h dwˆ
w, (A.1)
where f, g, and h are functions of position characteristic of the particular coor-
dinate system (in Cartesian coordinates f= g= h= 1; in spherical coordinates
f= 1, g= r , h= r sin θ; and in cylindrical coordinates f= h= 1, g= s). As
you’ll soon see, these three functions tell you everything you need to know about
a coordinate system.

A.4 Divergence 577
From Eq. A.3 it follows that the total change in t, as you go from point a to
point b (Fig. A.1), is
t (b)− t (a)=
b
a
dt=
b
a
(∇t)· dl, (A.5)
which is the fundamental theorem for gradients (not much to prove, really, in
this case). Notice that the integral is independent of the path taken from a to b.
A.4 DIVERGENCE
Suppose that we have a vector function,
A(u,v,w)= Au
ˆ
u + Av
ˆ
ˆ
v + Aw
w,
and we wish to evaluate the integral A· da over the surface of the infinitesi-
mal volume generated by starting at the point (u,v,w) and increasing each of
the coordinates in succession by an infinitesimal amount (Fig. A.2). Because the
coordinates are orthogonal, this is (at least, in the infinitesimal limit) a rectangu-
lar solid, whose sides have lengths dlu = f du, dlv = g dv, and dlw = h dw, and
whose volume is therefore
dτ = dlu dlv dlw = ( f gh)du dv dw. (A.6)
(The sides are not just du, dv, dw—after all, v might be an angle, in which case
dv doesn’t even have the dimensions of length. The correct expressions follow
from Eq. A.1.)
For the front surface,
da = −(gh)dv dwˆ
u,
so that
A· da = −(gh Au )dv dw.
The back surface is identical (except for the sign), only this time the quantity
gh Au is to be evaluated at (u + du), instead of u. Since for any (differentiable)
function F(u),
d F
F(u + du)− F(u)=

du
(in the limit), the front and back together amount to a contribution

and Eq. A.7 becomes
A· da = (∇· A)dτ. (A.9)
Using Table A.1, you can now derive the formulas for the divergence in Cartesian,
spherical, and cylindrical coordinates, which appear in the front cover of the book.
A.5 Curl 579
FIGURE A.3
As it stands, Eq. A.9 does not prove the divergence theorem, for it pertains
only to infinitesimal volumes, and rather special infinitesimal volumes at that. Of
course, a finite volume can be broken up into infinitesimal pieces, and Eq. A.9
can be applied to each one. The trouble is, when you then add up all the bits, the
left-hand side is not just an integral over the outer surface, but over all those tiny
internal surfaces as well. Luckily, however, these contributions cancel in pairs,
for each internal surface occurs as the boundary of two adjacent infinitesimal vol-
umes, and since da always points outward, A· da has the opposite sign for the
two members of each pair (Fig. A.3). Only those surfaces that bound a single
chunk—which is to say, only those at the outer boundary—survive when every-
thing is added up. For finite regions, then,
A· da = (∇· A)dτ, (A.10)
and you need integrate only over the external surface.2 This establishes the diver-
gence theorem.
A.5 CURL
To obtain the curl in curvilinear coordinates, we calculate the line integral,
A· dl,
around the infinitesimal loop generated by starting at (u,v,w) and successively
increasing u and v by infinitesimal amounts, holding w constant (Fig. A.4). The
surface is a rectangle (at least, in the infinitesimal limit), of length dlu = f du,
width dlv = g dv, and area
da = ( f g)du dvˆ
w. (A.11)
2What about regions that cannot be fit perfectly by rectangular solids no matter how tiny they are—
such as planes cut at an angle to the coordinate lines? It’s not hard to dispose of this case; try thinking
it out for yourself, or look at H. M. Schey’s Div, Grad, Curl and All That (New York: W. W. Norton,
1973), starting with Prob. II-15.

Assuming the coordinate system is right-handed,ˆ

Along the bottom segment,

so
A· dl= ( f Au )du.

and Eq. A.11 generalizes to
A· dl= (∇ × A)· da. (A.14)
Using Table A.1, you can now derive the formulas for the curl in Cartesian, spher-
ical, and cylindrical coordinates.
Equation A.14 does not by itself prove Stokes’ theorem, however, because at
this point it pertains only to very special infinitesimal surfaces. Again, we can
chop any finite surface into infinitesimal pieces and apply Eq. A.14 to each one
(Fig. A.5). When we add them up, though, we obtain (on the left) not only a
line integral around the outer boundary, but a lot of tiny line integrals around the
internal loops as well. Fortunately, as before, the internal contributions cancel in
pairs, because every internal line is the edge of two adjacent loops running in
opposite directions. Consequently, Eq. A.14 can be extended to finite surfaces,
A· dl= (∇ × A)· da, (A.15)
and the line integral is to be taken over the external boundary only.3 This estab-
lishes Stokes’ theorem.

front cover.
3What about surfaces that cannot be fit perfectly by tiny rectangles, no matter how small they are (such
as triangles) or surfaces that do not correspond to holding one coordinate fixed? If such cases trouble
you, and you cannot resolve them for yourself, look at H. M. Schey’s Div, Grad, Curl, and All That,
Prob. III-2 (New York: W. W. Norton, 1973).
A P P E N D I X
B The Helmholtz Theorem
Suppose we are told that the divergence of a vector function F(r) is a specified
scalar function D(r):
∇· F= D, (B.1)
and the curl of F(r) is a specified vector function C(r):
∇ × F= C. (B.2)
For consistency, C must be divergenceless,
∇· C= 0, (B.3)
because the divergence of a curl is always zero. Question: can we, on the basis
of this information, determine the function F? If D(r) and C(r) go to zero suffi-
ciently rapidly at infinity, the answer is yes, as I will show by explicit construction.
I claim that
F= −∇U + ∇ × W, (B.4)
where
U (r) ≡
1
4π
D(r′)
dτ′ (B.5)
r
and
C(r′)
W(r) ≡
1
4π
dτ′; (B.6)
r
the integrals are over all of space, and, as always, r = |r− r′|. For if F is given
by Eq. B.4, then its divergence (using Eq. 1.102) is
∇· F = −∇2U= −
1
4π
D ∇2 1
r
dτ′
= D(r′)δ3(r− r′)dτ′
= D(r).
(Remember that the divergence of a curl is zero, so the W term drops out, and
note that the differentiation is with respect to r, which is contained in r.)
So the divergence is right; how about the curl?
∇ × F= ∇ × (∇ × W) = −∇2W + ∇(∇· W). (B.7)
582
Appendix B The Helmholtz Theorem 583
(Since the curl of a gradient is zero, the U term drops out.) Now
1
−∇2W= −
4π
C ∇2 1
r
dτ′
= C(r′)δ3(r− r′)dτ′
= C(r),
which is perfect—I’ll be done if I can just persuade you that the second term
on the right side of Eq. B.7 vanishes. Using integration by parts (Eq. 1.59), and
noting that derivatives of r with respect to primed coordinates differ by a sign
from those with respect to unprimed coordinates, we have
4π∇· W= C· ∇

= − C· ∇′ 1

· C dτ−

C· da. (B.8)
r
But the divergence of C is zero, by assumption (Eq. B.3), and the surface integral
(way out at infinity) will vanish, as long as C goes to zero sufficiently rapidly.
Of course, that proof tacitly assumes that the integrals in Eqs. B.5 and B.6
converge—otherwise U and W don’t exist at all. At the large r ′ limit, where
r ≈ r ′, the integrals have the form
∞ X (r ′)
r ′2 dr ′
r ′
=
∞
r ′ X (r ′)dr ′
. (B.9)
(Here X stands for D or C, as the case may be). Obviously, X (r ′) must go to zero
at large r ′—but that’s not enough: if X∼ 1/r ′, the integrand is constant, so the
integral blows up, and even if X∼ 1/r ′2, the integral is a logarithm, which is still
no good at r ′ → ∞. Evidently the divergence and curl of F must go to zero more
rapidly than 1/r 2 for the proof to hold. (Incidentally, this is more than enough to
ensure that the surface integral in Eq. B.8 vanishes.)
Now, assuming these conditions on D(r) and C(r) are met, is the solution
in Eq. B.4 unique? The answer is clearly no, for we can add to F any vector
function whose divergence and curl both vanish, and the result still has divergence
D and curl C. However, it so happens that there is no function that has zero
divergence and zero curl everywhere and goes to zero at infinity (see Sect. 3.1.5).
So if we include a requirement that F(r) goes to zero as r → ∞, then solution
B.4 is unique.1
Now that all the cards are on the table, I can state the Helmholtz theorem
more rigorously:
If the divergence D(r) and the curl C(r) of a vector function F(r) are spec-
ified, and if they both go to zero faster than 1/r 2 as r → ∞, and if F(r)
goes to zero as r → ∞, then F is given uniquely by Eq. B.4.
1Typically we do expect the electric and magnetic fields to go to zero at large distances from the
charges and currents that produce them, so this is not an unreasonable stipulation. Occasionally one
encounters artificial problems in which the charge or current distribution itself extends to infinity—
infinite wires, for instance, or infinite planes. In such cases, other means must be found to establish
the existence and uniqueness of solutions to Maxwell’s equations.
584 Appendix B The Helmholtz Theorem
The Helmholtz theorem has an interesting corollary:
Any (differentiable) vector function F(r) that goes to zero faster than 1/r
as r → ∞ can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar plus the curl of a
vector:2
F(r)= ∇−1

B(r)= ∇ ×

(where A is the vector potential).

2As a matter of fact, any differentiable vector function whatever (regardless of its behavior at infinity)
can be written as a gradient plus a curl, but this more general result does not follow directly from the
Helmholtz theorem, nor does Eq. B.10 supply the explicit construction, since the integrals, in general,
diverge.

where c is the speed of light, and current is measured in esu/s. The Gaussian unit
of magnetic field (the gauss) is the one quantity from this system in everyday use:
people speak of volts, amperes, henries, and so on (all SI units), but for some rea-
son they tend to measure magnetic fields in gauss (the Gaussian unit); the correct
SI unit is the tesla (104 gauss).
One major virtue of the Gaussian system is that electric and magnetic fields
have the same dimensions (in principle, one could measure the electric fields in
gauss too, though no one uses the term in this context). Thus the Lorentz force
law, which we have written
