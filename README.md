# Project Oscillo

**Project Oscillo** is an AI-powered physics professor designed to teach college-level electromagnetism and wave physics (APLY101). Oscillo mimics a real professor by generating and presenting interactive PowerPoint slides to a class of students, aiming to make learning engaging, personalized, and effective.

## Project Goals

- **AI-Led Lectures:** Automatically generate and present lecture slides (PPTs) on electromagnetism and waves.
- **Real-Classroom Experience:** Simulate the teaching style and content delivery of a human professor.
- **Learning Analytics:** Track student understanding and adapt presentations for better outcomes.

## Current Plan

- **Prototype with Pre-Built Models:**  
  Start by experimenting with existing AI models for text and slide generation.
- **Performance Analysis:**  
  Measure model loss and calculate improvement percentages as the AI is refined.
- **Iterative Enhancement:**  
  Analyze results to guide improvements in teaching quality and student engagement.
